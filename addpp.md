            "Schools replace History and Geography with Computer Programming\nThe Australian Federal Government recently decided to replace history and geography as compulsory subjects in secondary school and bring in computer programming classes instead. This will see students from as young as Primary 5 learning about how a computer works and how to write their own computer programs. Computer classes in school used to be about learning how to use Ms Word and Excel - now it's looking at the world like an engineer - developing logical thinking and creativity.\nThe move makes sense given how much technology is in our lives and practically every job requires you to demonstrate some kind of computer skills. Equipping children with advanced computer skills early on in life could help them secure a bright future in a world which is becoming more high tech. This is something that other countries like the US and UK are already doing.\nHowever, some people think that teaching children history and geography is equally important. Studying history teaches children to learn from the mistakes people made in the past, which will help them to develop sound decision-making and judgement skills. Likewise, studying geography helps us to understand the connectivity between people and places and to appreciate the Earth as the home that we all share. It can teach us how to better manage the planet's resources and to become a better global citizen."

            "Great teacher = great results?\nThe great teacher myth is often presented as a simple equation: great teaching gets great results. Many people support it but it is completely wrong.\nThe great teacher myth sounds plausible. After all, children spend a lot of time at school and we spend a great deal of money on education.By the time they are 16,children have been at school for 10,000 hours, which is often said to be the minimum needed to master a skill. Surely teachers must be the biggest factor in ensuring that all this effort is worthwhile?\nThe key problem with this idea is when it comes to exams and learning, children are the ones who actually have to do the hard work. Unfortunately, much to the frustration of every teacher - and parent -in the city, children don't always do what they are told,or learn what we attempt to teach them.What's more, some children find school and learning easy and some don't.\nTrying to teach anyone anything is difficult unless they actually want to learn, and can do so. Learning is hard work; it requires effort, repetition, practice, mental and physical exertion.\nDoes that mean that teachers don't matter? Of course it doesn't. They help and provide excellent support, but we should understand they are not the most important factor in educational success."

This green initiative was welcomed.\nNow, in this new academic year, one department at HKU has implemented an unprecedented policy - a ban on giving printed paper handouts to students..\nI believe this is the right thing to do, and the initiative should be adopted by other departments and the other universities in Hong Kong as well.\nA semester at our universities lasts about three months, so students will use any handouts that they are given for a very short period of time only.After the term ends,they will probably not be read again.\nSometimes, lecturers even print out in-class activity materials that are only used for a few minutes. This is such a tremendous waste of paper.\nNearly all university students these days own laptops. These can be used to access online learning resources systems (in HKU and most of the other universities, it is called Moodle) onto which lecturers will upload teaching materials. As long as teachers upload their handouts, there is no need for printouts.\nThis can significantly reduce the amount of paper used for teaching purposes. It is through this kind of cooperation that we can ensure the sustainability of our world.\nAnson C.Y. Chan, North Point"

            "Laid-back life in Taiwan is very tempting\nI refer to Nick Westra's article \"Why are so many Hongkongers moving to Taiwan?\". I agree that a lot of people from Hong Kong are realising that Taiwan is the ideal place for them to settle down.\nThe living environment in Hong Kong is becoming more difficult. Costs keep rising in what is already one of the most expensive cities in the world, especially when it comes to property prices and rent. People have to work long hours to earn enough to cover living expenses. They don't have enough time to spend with their families and are so tired that on Sundays they often sleep all day.\nLife in the city is too hectic, and the workplace is too competitive.\nHowever, the pace of life is much slower in Taiwan. I think you can enjoy a much less complicated way of life there and being away from the fierce competition in Hong Kong's offices must be very liberating.\nFamilies with children can have a good quality of life because, although the salaries are lower in Taiwan, the cost of living is also much lower.\nWhile it is a big change in lifestyle, I am sure people who relocate to Taiwan will eventually adapt to living there and enjoy living there.\nLily Wong, Kwai Chung"

Then recruits are assigned to fire stations around Hong Kong to begin a three-year probation period. \"On-the-job field training is very important because this is where recruits are dealing with real-life scenarios,\" says Wong.

            "Will everyone be eating insects by 2050?\nBy 2050 the population is expected to reach 9billion. To feed all of those hungry mouths, we will need to produce almost twice as much food as we currently do. But that isn't going to be easy. One possible solution? Insects.\nEating insects is a common practice that's been taking place for thousands of years. Around 2 billion people regularly eat insects as part of their diet, and over 1,900 species are edible. The most commonly eaten bugs are beetles, caterpillars, bees, wasps and ants.\nSo what's so good about insects? Well, they're nutritious and healthy. Insects actually have a high fat, protein, vitamin, fibre and mineral content that is often comparable to fish or livestock. Beetles, for example, contain on average 205 g/kg protein; beef contains 256 g/kg.\nRaising insects as a source of food as opposed to farmed animals is more environmentally friendly. Insects require significantly less land and water than traditionally-farmed animals and also reproduce much more quickly. Additionally, insects produce a fraction of the greenhouse gases when compared with other livestock, particularly cattle. Finally, insect farming can provide jobs and income to people living in poor areas. Insects are sustainable, green, nutritious and could help people out of poverty. Chocolate-covered caterpillars, anyone?"

He said, 'I had a good business and a good life when one day I was pulled from my bed into an alien spacecraft' At first he refused to co-operate with the aliens. But as the years passed, he got to understand more about them and even seemed to have won the trust of the aliens. 'They know us better as a person than we know ourselves. Not only can they read our minds, they also have the technology to be invisible,' Sparks insists.\nWhile many of the audience listened quietly, some had clearly had enough. One of those who headed for the door said, 'He's a pretty good storyteller because he seems so sincere, but for me it's too much like science-fiction.'"

            "Body art expresses individuality\nMore and more teenagers are turning to different forms of body art, such as tattooing and nose piercing, to establish their personal identity and look different. One of the main reasons young people decide to modify their bodies is to look cool. Teenagers want to express their individuality and have a strong desire to stand out from the crowd. This gives them a sense of uniqueness that makes them different from everyone else.\n19-year-old James Keen is a typical example. He is one of the first in Hong Kong to have had the tip of his tongue split into two.'When I first saw it in some teen magazines,I thought tongue-splitting was the most beautiful thing I'd seen in my life,' says James. Most of his friends do not know that he has had his tongue split unless he shows it to them.When asked how he felt about the splitting process, James said it did cause some pain for about a week, especially when he ate,but he believed it was worthwhile.'Piercing of the ears,nose and lips is just too common.I wanted something different.'"

In Japan, it is called death by overwork and it is estimated to cause 1,000 deaths per year. In the USA, it is known as the 'respectable' addiction.\nAddiction to work is not the same as working hard or putting in long hours. Hard-working people generally have some balance in their lives. They spend a lot of time at work,but also set aside time for their hobbies, such as playing sport. However, work addicts think about work even when they are playing sport. The obsession with work is total. It prevents them from maintaining healthy relationships and outside interests. Work addicts neglect their health and ignore their friends and family. They avoid going on holiday so they don't have to miss work,and even if they do go on holiday,they still think about work.\nOften, work addicts only realize they have a problem when something terrible happens, for example,when their health completely fails or they start having family problems."

Maybe snacks might help....\"\n- \"I couldn't get myself to read the first book and then I felt bad, so I didn't come back.\"\n- \"I never had a chance to participate - always the same people who dominate the discussion.\"\n- \"Do we have to learn vocabulary and grammar?

Instead, vocational education and training (VET) is a very common pathway to gain skills and embark on a successful career. VET combines job-training and study, so students can both study and work at the same time. VET offers certifications for people who are interested in becoming an electrician, tax specialist, nurse, ambulance worker, dental technician, hairdresser, film and video editor, and product designer.\nDepending on the job, trainees may work for three to four days a week in the company, factory, or shop to learn practical skills through on-the-job training. Trainees earn a modest salary which helps with student expenses.\nOn the other days, students go to school to learn both job-specific and general education subjects, such as English, maths, and physical education. The program usually lasts between two and four years. At the end of the training, students take an examination and are then given their certifications. They can continue to work in the place they were trained, study to obtain further qualifications or even become self-employed.\nThe VET program supplies Germany's companies with well-trained employees. It also helps trainees transition into work life. VET opens up a variety of promising career options for young people. Both young people and adults wanting to change careers can take part."

            "The smells of Hong Kong\nHong Kong is 'fragrant harbour' in Cantonese. There are actually many different smells, not necessarily pleasant and fragrant, that can make people think of this city. The following are some examples.\nMoney\nHong Kong is a financial centre in Asia. It is no surprise that the smell of money, both banknotes and coins, is a symbolic smell of the city.\nSeafood\nOne never forgets the strong smell of dried seafood in Sheung Wan and the smell of shrimp paste in Sai Kung. All over Hong Kong, in wet markets, the odour of fish stalls is another reminder of how close Hong Kong is to the sea.\nJoss sticks and incense\nIn Chinese temples, burning joss sticks and incense gives off a relaxing and woody fragrance that reflects the cultural roots of Hong Kong.\nStreet food\nHong Kong people love street food, particularly food that has strong flavours and smells: curry fish balls, stinky tofu, egg tarts and fried chestnuts.\nExhaust fumes on the road\nUnpleasant as it may be, the smell of the exhaust gases from cars, lorries and buses all year round just reflects the busy traffic and the energy of the city.\nGreenery\nContrary to most people's first impression, 75 percent of Hong Kong's territory is actually green: country parks, agricultural or semi-rural land. The refreshing and calming scents of trees and grass always offer escape from the stress of city life."

Edgar Cheung Ka-long, Hong Kong's double Olympic champion would know.\nIn fact, Cheung didn't take up fencing until he was 10 years old. \"All the basketball classes were closed during the summer,\"he recalls. \"My father asked if I would be interested in a fencing course. I still remember it was a summer course for beginners. We practised footwork but that was all. Towards the end of the course,the teacher asked if anybody would like to try it with a real fence. Many of my classmates raised their hands, but I was too shy to do it in front of people. Even today, I would still consider myself an introvert. I'm not used to presenting myself during public appearances,\" he explains.\nCheung made his Olympic debut at the 2016 Rio Games. At the 2018 Asian Games, he helped Hong Kong win a silver medal in the team event. In Tokyo, his incredible run to gold included an unbelievable victory against his Italian rival in the final match. Finally, in Paris, he became the first Hong Kong athlete to win consecutive Olympic gold medals.\n\"I am happy to have won the Olympic gold medals. This is the dream of every athlete,\" Cheung says. \"But more importantly the gold medal has made a great impact on society, ensuring more Hong Kong people know about fencing and more youngsters are willing to take up the sport.\""

In some places, however, people are pushing back against this trend.\nVermont, USA\nOfficials in this town recently voted to close its roads in autumn, when the leaves of the trees turn colour and the area is at its most beautiful. Hundreds of tourists began going there to take photos, and many were parking near people's private homes, damaging property and even arguing with local residents. \"Traffic in this area has steadily increased, causing environmental, safety, and quality of life issues,\"the town reported.\nMount Fuji, Japan\nIn May 2024, a Japanese town built a wall to block views of Mount Fuji, Japan's most famous mountain. Large groups of tourists started going there to take photos and refused to obey rules on throwing trash and parking. One resident said,\"When visitors don't respect rules, leave litter behind and ignore traffic regulations, then as regrettable as it is, we have to take action.\"\nBerlin, Germany\nBefore opening N&S, one of Germany's top-rated restaurants, owner Billy Wagner set a 'no photos, no videos' rule for the place. He mentions two reasons for the rule: privacy for the other diners and appreciation for the food. \"I was interested in analogue focus, which is what a restaurant visit is really all about: to smell, taste, feel, see.\" He felt that the only way that people could have that focus was to put their phones away."

            "As PC ownership declines, smartphones are on the rise\nDuring the 1990s, as personal computers or 'PCs' - including desktops and laptop computers - became more user-friendly, ownership of these devices increased dramatically. In the US, households owning a PC rose from 15%in1990 to 35%in1997.As the internet became more popular and usable, ownership continued to rise, and by 2007, about 271 million people worldwide owned a PC.\nVS\nIn that same year, something incredible happened. Apple released the iPhone, the world's first modern smartphone. That year, 124 million smartphones were sold;, within four years, smartphone sales surpassed those of PCs.By 2015, sales of smartphones were nearly five times higher than those of PCs.\nAlthough PC ownership received a brief boost during the Covid-19 pandemic, when many people had to work from home, that was short-lived. In 2022, sales of PCs dropped by 20% from the previous year, and worldwide PC sales fell again in 2023 and 2024. Smartphone sales, meanwhile, have been rising by about 10% year on year, and by 2024,nearly 60% of all web traffic was from mobile devices.\nDoes this mean that the PC is dead? Not quite, say analysts. For people who work mostly in one place, for instance, a PC is more convenient, and for gamers who play high-end video games that require a lot of power, PCs are clearly better than phones.\nIn the end, analysts say, the device you choose to use is the one that works best for you."

Since 2019, the consumption pattern of Hong Kong people in Shenzhen has gradually shifted from spending on leisure activities to everyday purchases, from dining and entertainment to medical check-ups, grocery shopping and even real estate purchases.\nTake supermarket shopping as an example. Sam's Club in Shenzhen has recently become a hit among families from Hong Kong. During weekends and holidays, it is common to see Hong Kong people stocking up on groceries and also enjoying dining after shopping.\nAaron Chan spent his New Year holidays in Shenzhen, during which he tried hot pot and barbecue and drank a lot of milk tea. \"The cost of a good meal is half the price. In Shenzhen, you are spoilt for choice and the fruit and vegetables are much cheaper,\"he stated.\nApart from being cheaper and the variety it offers, Shenzhen is attracting more people because of its high-quality services. A visitor from Hong Kong, Sally Wu, said that she had noticed great improvements in the quality of service in Shenzhen over the last few years. \"For example, service staff there will proactively inform you about discount offers, and their friendly attitude makes you feel comfortable,\" she added."

            "American teenagers today are driving less than their parents did\n14 years ago, when Zachary Grand turned 17, he couldn't wait to get his driving licence. Back then, a driving licence was considered a sign of adulthood: you were not a child anymore and could travel around freely, not depending on anyone else.\nHow times have changed. While the share of US teenagers with a driving licence was over 65% in 1995, today it is below 40%. In cities that have good public transport, the percentage is even lower.\nGrand notes that teens do not want to get their driving licences anymore. \"When I recently moved from California to Chicago, I was really surprised to see that so few young people here want to drive. It's incredible!\"\nThe reasons behind this trend are many, and complicated. For one thing, car costs have increased a lot and so have the prices of petrol and insurance. Additionally, cities and towns have grown more crowded and less car-friendly, and many states in the US have made it harder for teenagers to get a driving licence.\nTechnology is also a factor. Things that teens used to do in person - hanging out with friends, taking classes, shopping for clothes, playing games - can now be done online. Ride-hailing apps like Uber and home delivery apps have also made driving less necessary.\n\"You can do anything from your phone,\" Grand says. \"Call an Uber or even book a train or bus if you want to.\""

            "How phobias happen, and what you can do if you have an irrational fear\nHave you heard of Chelonaphobia, or fear of turtles? Emily Ko, a Hong Kong-born freelance writer is scared of turtles, and while it sounds silly to most people, that's exactly what a phobia is - an extreme fear of a threat and expecting danger that's out of proportion to the actual risk.\n\"I was five years old when my parents came home with two pet turtles,\" Emily says. \"I freaked out. Obviously, my parents didn't throw away the turtles - they put them in my brother's room. But these things live long lives...I didn't go into that bedroom for 10 years.\"\nHong Kong-based hypnotherapist Sonia Samtani has dealt with a range of phobias - some common, some not. \"I've treated people for fear of public speaking, cockroaches, needles, medical procedures, flying and dark spaces, and less common phobias such as cats, escalators, and pigeons.\" Samtani says phobias can also eat away at a person's self-confidence and self-esteem. The impact may get more severe if that person doesn't know why they are scared of something.\nHowever, there are techniques that can help people overcome even the most extreme phobias. One popular type of treatment that helps people change the way they think and behave, is to gradually expose them to their fear so they feel less anxious about it. In this way, people don't have to suffer from phobias all their lives."

The company defended its tours and said it was committed to helping \"build a responsible tourism community and improve the lives of animals in the travel industry.\"\n\"Our approach is to continually work with operators to encourage long-term and sustainable change, which not only takes into consideration animal welfare but also communities who are directly impacted by the industry,\" a company spokesperson said. \"We continue to work with our partners across the world to achieve this. One example is elephant tourism in Thailand, which comes with a cultural and religious heritage, and is beneficial for the local communities and the economy,\"she added.\nEarlier this year, the travel company vowed to end ticketing for some animal attractions. Under its new policy, situations where wild animals are drugged or abused are banned. This ban extends to circuses and shows during which animals are forced to perform unnatural behaviour.\nHowever, the animal welfare NGO, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, shared a video that showed dead bodies of horses and camels outside a tourist site in Egypt. While camel-riding activities in Egypt are listed as \"currently unavailable\" on Vapido's website, the company continues to offer camel rides in places including Dubai, Morocco, and Turkey."

            "Music groups no longer dominate the pop charts\nWhen the British rock group The Beatles first visited America in 1964, it set off a musical explosion. Not only did this group become hugely popular around the world, but young people everywhere also started buying musical instruments and forming pop and rock groups of their own.\nFor the rest of the 20th century, music groups dominated the pop charts. In the year 2000, for instance, over 80% of the songs listed in the 'Hot 100' biggest musical acts compiled by Billboard magazine were by pop,rock or hip-hop groups.\nHow times have changed. According to recent data, very few of the hottest songs from the year 2024 were from music groups. In August 2024, only one group, Imagine Dragons, had a hit in the Global Top 50. Individual performers like Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Eminem and Dua Lipa now dominate the charts.\nWhile there are many reasons for this trend,experts say that the biggest factor has been the rise of social media. As music executive Chris Price notes, social media \"is mainly a solo activity. It's easier as an individual singer to express what kind of artist you are on YouTube or Instagram than for four people to do the same thing.\"\nAnother factor is the improved technology for recording music alone, as software like Ableton Live allows people to make high-quality music at home. \"In the past, if you wanted to make music for people to dance to, you needed a band,\"says Price. \"Now you just need a laptop.\""

            "The art of self-care\nMore often than not, we are busy with work, maintaining our friendships and checking in with our families. And as we enjoy taking care of others, it's also important to take care of ourselves. Self-care is key to our physical and mental health.\n\"Self-care is when you engage in activities that take care of yourself,\" Valerie Ho, the founder of an e-commerce platform specializing in self-care products, explains. When we do not engage in self-care activities, \"physically, we feel the symptoms of stress, things like increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, headaches, and stomach upsets. From a mental health perspective, there is an increase in anxiety or depression, and emotionally, people may find themselves more easily irritated or crying without any reason,\" says Odile Thiang from MindHK, an NGO focusing on wellbeing among Hong Kong people.\nAccording to Odile, there are three pillars of self-care - exercise, sleep, and diet. Regular exercise is not only important for your physical health, but from a mental health perspective, it has been shown to treat feelings of anxiety and depression. Getting enough sleep is also an incredibly important part of self-care and helps us recharge. And watching what you eat is beneficial to both your body and your emotions.\nIf you don't know where to start, Odile suggests trying coupling - pairing something you love with something you know is good for you, but you're not too keen on. \"A lot of people find it hard to get motivated about exercising, so couple it with watching your favourite Netflix show.\""

            "Why Spirited Away Changed Animation Forever\nIn 2001, one of the most celebrated anime movies hit theatres in Japan. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli, Spirited Away would leave a mark on animation in the 21st century.\nThe story follows an ordinary 10-year-old girl, Chihiro, as she arrives at a deserted theme park that turns into a world of spirits at night. Her parents are turned into pigs by Yubaba, the witch who manages a bathhouse serving otherworldly customers. Chihiro must work in the bathhouse to save her parents and find a way to return home. The story is a tale of resilience,as Chihiro gradually finds her inner strength.\nThe movie arrived at a time when people thought animation was for children. Spirited Away destroyed prejudice about the art form and proved that a movie created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore could reach global audiences of all ages.\nJane Napier, a film critic, underlines the global impact of the movie. The movie's theme is uncertainty. \"I think this is one reason why this movie is so popular, it recognizes that the world can be scary, and that we don't always know what's going to happen to us,\" Napier explains.\nTo Yoshioka, a Studio Ghibli fan, Spirited Away can be interpreted in numerous ways by the viewer. \"This is key for the film to be loved as a classic,\" he says. \"So, even 20 years on, Spirited Away is a movie that can be watched and rewatched.\""

            "Can a personality test help decide your future career?\nThe Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a self-reported personality test that can help you find out what kind of person you are. Among other things,the test assesses people's likes, dislikes, personal preferences, and possible career paths.\nThere are 16 personality types in total in the test. Many young people nowadays take the test to see if it can help them choose a suitable future job.\nAccording to LinkedIn, a website that helps people find suitable careers, job seekers can use the MBTI test in multiple ways. First, it can help them identify their strengths, weaknesses, preferred work style, and ability to get along with others. Additionally, people can find lists online showing how common each MBTI type is in various fields of work,which can help them choose a career that matches their personality.\n\"By using the MBTI, you can discover your personality type and how it influences your work preferences, behaviours, and outcomes,\" the site reports. \"You can also use the MBTI to find careers that match your type.\"\nHowever,it is not only potential employees who use the MBTI but employers as well. In China, many companies, including large international ones, now require job applicants to complete the test, and it is one of the factors that may help them decide whether to hire someone-or not.\n\"Some companies may not want to hire someone whose personality test results do not suit their goals,\" said Ning, a senior media executive."

For example, the groups aim to end poverty, reduce inequality and combat climate change.\nLearning key values\nFrom as young as six, boys and girls can join to learn about nature while playing games, making friends and learning important values. \"The key values of a Scout are respect for others, for oneself and for the environment\" says Morgan, a Belgian Scout leader. In Greece, for example, Scouts are given tips on how they can implement the SDGs in their daily lives, such as by asking for a donation to charity instead of a gift on their birthday to achieve Goal 1: No Poverty; or by not letting their tap run when brushing their teeth for Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.\nEveryone is welcome\nInclusion is an important principle of Scouting. \"Everyone is welcome in Scouting. One of the most important values for young people taking part is that everyone can participate and that you can be yourself,\" says Takahashi, Director of Scouting Japan. \"Cooking together at camp or sleeping in a tent promotes community life and respect for different opinions,\" says Luc, another Scout leader from Luxembourg.\nGlobal solidarity\nScouting not only brings young people together at a national level, but also internationally. Thousands of young members from 171 countries meet every four years at the World Scout Jamboree. Held in a different location each time, the 10-day educational event promotes peace and friendship."

            "A daring heart: Meet the bamboo scaffolders of Hong Kong\nIntricate bamboo scaffolding is still part of the cityscape in Hong Kong. The metropolis is one of the world's last remaining cities to use bamboo scaffolding in construction and building repair. Luckily, the Construction Industry Council (CIC) and its students are keeping this sustainable skill alive.\nScaffolders perched on bamboo frames several storeys high are a common sight, and are nicknamed 'spiders' by Hong Kong people for their agility over the scaffold.\nMo Jia Yu wraps his legs around a pole to balance high above the ground and secure a joint, a skill he must master to become a bamboo scaffolder in Hong Kong. \"You have to have a daring heart,\" says Mo, one of dozens of students who enrol each year at the CIC to learn the traditional method. \"You need courage as well as skill to survive,\"says Professor Chang from the Architecture Department of the University of Hong Kong. \"This discourages people from going into the industry.\"\nDespite the dangers involved in the craft, Chang hopes Hong Kong will preserve it as part of its cultural heritage.\nBamboo is readily available across the border in southern Chinese provinces. Its price and efficiency makes it popular, while lightweight bamboo is also easier to transport through a cramped urban centre.\n\"Bamboo scaffolds are suited to the odd and tight spaces in Hong Kong,\" adds instructor Kin Kee Wo, who has worked in the construction industry for nearly 30 years. \"It can be built in the most unthinkable places, in the most beautiful ways.\""

Should shops be allowed to ban the sale of coffee and energy drinks to teenagers and kids?\nWhile Caligula Coffee isn't completely banning the sale of coffee to teenagers, the company's new policy allows its employees to deny serving them drinks that contain caffeine, including energy drinks. \"We do not encourage the sale of caffeine to children under 16,\" the company's spokesperson said. Some customers, including the 12-year-old's father, are upset. He expressed his outrage online saying his daughter just deserved a treat.\nBut not everyone is against a ban. The UK government, for example, has been working to prohibit the sale of coffee and energy drinks to teenagers after declaring the link between caffeine consumption and various health issues among younger consumers too strong to ignore.\nThe National Institute of Health (NIH) says that significant amounts of caffeine affect the heart and blood vessels. According to Dr George of the NIH, when it comes to teenagers and caffeine, education and moderation are both key.And it's also important to remember who you're talking to. \"Beware once you tell someone, especially teenagers, that they can't have something: they will find a way to get their hands on it.\""

            "Gap Year: Work or Travel?\nStudents always face many tests and exams. Taking a break from studies for a year and having a rest sounds attractive. A \"Gap year\", usually taken after the end of secondary school and before starting university, provides an opportunity for students to explore the world, look for a richer spiritual life and exchange cultural ideas.\nWhat did Hong Kong students do during their gap years? Oscar Chan Chi-kin, a year one business student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, didn't go to university immediately. Instead, he went to Singapore in his gap year and volunteered to help young people develop leadership skills. \"Instead of being career-driven, I hoped to gain a life direction and figure out what I love to do,\" he said. After the gap year,he knew what his ideal working environment would look like in his future career. \"Whether the company vision aligns with my personal values is really important.\"\nBesides travelling and volunteering, young people from Asia also choose to intern and work to enrich their resumés and sharpen their competitive edge. However, Sascha Choi On, a student who has just started studying at CUHK has a different view: \"Nowadays it's changing. Some of my friends took a gap year because they really wanted to find a sense of self, such as 'who I am' and 'what the goal in my life is'. Some students really care about their inner peace and happiness rather than just focusing on earning money\"she said."

            "Hong Kong's growing second-hand luxury clothes culture\nRedress, an NGO promoting sustainability through popularising second-hand fashion,is back with its seasonal \"Get Redressed #ShopSecondhand\" pop-up store in Hong Kong. Located at Taikoo Place, Quarry Bay, the second-hand pop-up store's success over the years shows a growing second-hand culture in the city. Meanwhile, online second-hand luxury fashion platforms like Hula, Vestiaire Collective and Little Dot Vintage sell discounted items from brands like Dior, Chanel, and Gucci.\nShoppers can expect to see donated second-hand clothes and accessories from all over Hong Kong, with pieces ranging from luxury designer labels to more trendy and affordable ones, according to Redress' event page. The clothing items up for resale are donated by people and collected through the NGO's takeback program. With something for everyone, the event is expected to be size- and gender-inclusive, while shoppers will be confident that they are reducing their carbon footprint by buying second-hand clothes that would otherwise end up in the city's landfills.\nAccording to Redress' 2020 study on Hong Kong's fashion consumption, changes in consumer habits were considerable after the pandemic,with two out of three actively changing their behaviour, and 30 per cent of respondents acknowledging the environmental cost of shopping habits. What is particularly interesting is that 31 per cent of respondents already own second-hand clothing, while 12 per cent have been reselling clothes online and offline as well There is no doubt about the sustainable fashion industry's potential in Hong Kong."

            "In trilingual Hong Kong, Korean language is the new kid on the block\nFor decades, French, Spanish, German and Japanese have been the most popular foreign languages among Hong Kong students. But in recent years, Korean has emerged as the new kid on the block. The latest estimate by the Korean consulate in Hong Kong showed that there were around 40,000 Korean learners in 2024 based on enrolment figures at universities and private academies.\nIn secondary schools, most Korean lessons are taught as extracurricular classes. But some have gone a step further to include the language in their curriculum as an elective. The introduction of Korean into the public school curriculum, although still at an early stage, is significant and a testament to its popularity, experts say. Professor Li Chor-Shing said the launching of Korean classes in public schools shows that many young people are motivated to learn Korean, and that it could help students with their future career prospects.\nTeachers say Korean has gained popularity in public schools as young people see learning Korean as more than just a hobby. Ms. Lai, who has taught Korean for over 10 years, said she has seen a shift in the past two to three years in the reasons young people want to learn the language. \"It used to be K-pop fans wanting to learn how to write 'Oppa, I love you' in letters to their idols,\" Ms. Lai said. \"But now, aside from that, students also see Korea as a study destination or they want to work there.\""

            "Urban beekeeping: A good idea?\nThousands have taken up urban beekeeping in Sydney. The reaction from neighbours is not always positive. Rob Simms has three beehives in his garden, and gives away jars of honey to keep his neighbours sweet. \"I delayed doing anything for six months because I thought I wouldn't get neighbour approval,\" Simms said. \"Now I give people jars of honey and everyone's happy.\"\nBut the beekeeping boom has created problems for urban living. Catherine Heath, a resident, considers herself pro-bee. However, this spring her garden has become a no-go zone because of aggressive bees, and she noticed an adjoining house had a sign on the front fence advertising homegrown honey. \"It's to the point that in good weather, we can't use the backyard most of the time\" Heath says. \"There are a lot of bees and they behave in a strange way. They attack both dogs and humans unprovoked.\"\nDouglas Purdie, president of Sydney Bee Club, said this was not unheard of. \"Bees, like all wild things, go through cycles and temperament, just like you can have a dog that's very nice today and tomorrow bites you,\"he said.\nThe Department of Primary Industries says Sydney has over 15,000 registered beekeepers and around 400,000 hives. Dr Tobias Smith, a researcher at the University of Queensland, comments that native Australian bees are stingless. \"If you have flowers around, they will just do their own thing, and you sit back and enjoy watching them,\" Smith said. \"They're a really easy pet.\""

            "Young people love subtitles; older people, not so much\nAnyone who has ever watched movies or TV shows should be familiar with subtitles.\nThese are words that are shown on the bottom or side of a screen to indicate what the speakers on screen are saying. For viewers to follow along with the story,the timing of the texts must be the same as the timing of the people speaking.\nOriginally, subtitles had two main purposes: to translate the words from a foreign language into your own language, and to allow people who have hearing problems to understand the words being spoken.\nRecently, however, there has been a new trend among young people in the UK. According to research, 4 out of 5 viewers between the age of 18-25 use subtitles all the time - even when watching movies or TV shows in their own language - while less than 25% of people aged between 56-75 do so.\n\"I think it's natural now for young people to accept subtitles,\" said UK media expert Melanie Sharpe. She added that while older people feel that using subtitles while listening to someone speak \"requires too much thinking,\" young people \"can take in far more information quickly because they're used to it.\"\nNobody knows exactly how this trend started, but one theory is that young people grew up with seeing subtitles on social media and are now comfortable with them.\nAnother factor may be the poor sound quality of streamed videos. \"They might be using subtitles because of background noise or changing volumes,\" Sharpe said."

            "An unusual career that may be one of the most desired jobs of the future\nAs artificial intelligence or 'AI' becomes more widely used and starts replacing some traditional jobs, many young people worry about their future careers.\nAccording to some experts, however, there is one popular job trend which will not be easily taken over by AI: being a 'personal shopper'.\nA personal shopper refers to a person who helps customers find products that they need by doing their shopping for them. Instead of visiting real stores or spending hours searching online, a customer with little free time can find a personal shopper with the right skills, knowledge and connections to help meet their needs.\n\"This is a job that has grown quickly,\" says American business executive Tom Ward. \"And it's grown in line with the way that customers want to shop.\"\nThe best personal shoppers have expert knowledge of their field. To become a professional clothing shopper, for instance, you need to learn everything about fashion, from the top designer names to the latest fashion trends.\nWhile AI assistants may also have such knowledge, the benefit of human shoppers is that when they visit stores to locate good quality or 'on sale' items, they build personal relationships with store owners and supply shops. This can help a human shopper see the quality of the goods, get the best possible prices, and even find unusual products not available online. These benefits, say retail experts, mean that human personal shoppers are still the best choice."

It was a tip Wei saw on Xiaohongshu, an Instagram-like social media platform popular on the Mainland and beyond.\nXiaohongshu, known for travel tips, has more than 200 million active users, with more than 70 per cent of the users born in the 1990s. The app has reshaped Hong Kong's tourism landscape, as influencers share ideas and tips for previously ordinary places. Some bring takeaways from McDonald's to MacDonnell Road in Mid-Levels for a fun photo. Others flock to Yau Ma Tei Police Station for a shot of the iconic building.\nAnother destination popularised on Xiaohongshu is a busy footbridge in Mong Kok. Colourful neon signs adorning the residential buildings are a popular draw for tourists, who want to capture the nostalgic vintage vibe of Hong Kong.\n\"The scenery, with some background music, seems quite romantic,\" a Malaysian tourist said. \"Hong Kong feels familiar because its dramas and films are very popular in Malaysia, and we go hunting for places we see on the app.\""

Day turns to night as you progress. You cross bridges into new lands.\" Super Mario Bros changed the way we play video games - \"from merely aiming for a high score to playing a game to experience an adventure and see it through to its ending,\"he said.\nTo celebrate Super Mario's 40th anniversary, Nintendo has launched Mario-centred games.

            "A hot social media site among teens is one people might not expect\nIf you were trying to guess which social media sites are becoming popular among teenagers, what would you choose? Snapchat? Instagram? Facebook?\nYou might be surprised to learn that a growing number of high schoolers are now turning to a site that is all about success at work: LinkedIn.\nThe world's largest online professional network, LinkedIn, helps people find the right jobs, connect with others in their field, make important professional connections and learn skills necessary for career success. It also allows users to join career-related discussions and to read, and comment on, articles from their field.\nAccording to recent studies, many teenagers in North America now see LinkedIn as the hottest social media platform. This is partly because they are trying to prepare themselves for today's fast-moving job market, but also because they like the positive tone of the site.\n\"When I go on Facebook,I just see people with horrible feelings and bad ideas,\" said one teenager. \"And when I go on LinkedIn, it's so positive and honest--this is how social media should be.\"\nMany secondary students also say that they like LinkedIn because it helps them to find role models, to follow their interests, and to learn about possible future job trends.\n\"I had been interviewing teenagers about social media,\" said journalist Anya Kamenetz. \"And I learned that this site is popular with those who are really focused on their futures."

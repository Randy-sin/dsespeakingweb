More often than not, we are busy with work, maintaining our friendships and checking in with our families. And as we enjoy taking care of others, it''s also important to take care of ourselves. Self-care is key to our physical and mental health.
\"Self-care is when you engage in activities that take care of yourself,\" Valerie Ho, the founder of an e-commerce platform specializing in self-care products, explains. When we do not engage in self-care activities, \"physically, we feel the symptoms of stress, things like increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, headaches, and stomach upsets. From a mental health perspective, there is an increase in anxiety or depression, and emotionally, people may find themselves more easily irritated or crying without any reason,\" says Odile Thiang from MindHK, an NGO focusing on wellbeing among Hong Kong people.
According to Odile, there are three pillars of self-care - exercise, sleep, and diet. Regular exercise is not only important for your physical health, but from a mental health perspective, it has been shown to treat feelings of anxiety and depression. Getting enough sleep is also an incredibly important part of self-care and helps us recharge. And watching what you eat is beneficial to both your body and your emotions.

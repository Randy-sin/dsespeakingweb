The great teacher myth is often presented as a simple equation: great teaching gets great results. Many people support it but it is completely wrong.
The great teacher myth sounds plausible. After all, children spend a lot of time at school and we spend a great deal of money on education.By the time they are 16,children have been at school for 10,000 hours, which is often said to be the minimum needed to master a skill. Surely teachers must be the biggest factor in ensuring that all this effort is worthwhile?
The key problem with this idea is when it comes to exams and learning, children are the ones who actually have to do the hard work. Unfortunately, much to the frustration of every teacher - and parent -in the city, children don''t always do what they are told,or learn what we attempt to teach them.What''s more, some children find school and learning easy and some don''t.
Trying to teach anyone anything is difficult unless they actually want to learn, and can do so. Learning is hard work; it requires effort, repetition, practice, mental and physical exertion.
Does that mean that teachers don''t matter? Of course it doesn''t. They help and provide excellent support, but we should understand they are not the most important factor in educational success.'], ARRAY[E'arguments for the motion', E'arguments against the motion', E'which side would be easier to argue', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Would you like to be a teacher?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think being a teacher is a good job?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What kind of students do teachers like?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What is the most important skill for a teacher to have?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do teachers get enough respect?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What characteristics make a good teacher?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Does learning require hard work?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you ever been inspired by a teacher?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Earlier this year, the University of Hong Kong banned the sale of disposable bottled water on its Pok Fu Lam campus. This green initiative was welcomed.
Now, in this new academic year, one department at HKU has implemented an unprecedented policy - a ban on giving printed paper handouts to students..
I believe this is the right thing to do, and the initiative should be adopted by other departments and the other universities in Hong Kong as well.
A semester at our universities lasts about three months, so students will use any handouts that they are given for a very short period of time only.After the term ends,they will probably not be read again.
Sometimes, lecturers even print out in-class activity materials that are only used for a few minutes. This is such a tremendous waste of paper.
Nearly all university students these days own laptops. These can be used to access online learning resources systems (in HKU and most of the other universities, it is called Moodle) onto which lecturers will upload teaching materials. As long as teachers upload their handouts, there is no need for printouts.
This can significantly reduce the amount of paper used for teaching purposes. It is through this kind of cooperation that we can ensure the sustainability of our world.

I refer to Nick Westra''s article "Why are so many Hongkongers moving to Taiwan?". I agree that a lot of people from Hong Kong are realising that Taiwan is the ideal place for them to settle down.
The living environment in Hong Kong is becoming more difficult. Costs keep rising in what is already one of the most expensive cities in the world, especially when it comes to property prices and rent. People have to work long hours to earn enough to cover living expenses. They don''t have enough time to spend with their families and are so tired that on Sundays they often sleep all day.
Life in the city is too hectic, and the workplace is too competitive.
However, the pace of life is much slower in Taiwan. I think you can enjoy a much less complicated way of life there and being away from the fierce competition in Hong Kong''s offices must be very liberating.
Families with children can have a good quality of life because, although the salaries are lower in Taiwan, the cost of living is also much lower.
While it is a big change in lifestyle, I am sure people who relocate to Taiwan will eventually adapt to living there and enjoy living there.

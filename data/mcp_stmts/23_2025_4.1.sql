In 2001, one of the most celebrated anime movies hit theatres in Japan. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli, Spirited Away would leave a mark on animation in the 21st century.
The story follows an ordinary 10-year-old girl, Chihiro, as she arrives at a deserted theme park that turns into a world of spirits at night. Her parents are turned into pigs by Yubaba, the witch who manages a bathhouse serving otherworldly customers. Chihiro must work in the bathhouse to save her parents and find a way to return home. The story is a tale of resilience,as Chihiro gradually finds her inner strength.
The movie arrived at a time when people thought animation was for children. Spirited Away destroyed prejudice about the art form and proved that a movie created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore could reach global audiences of all ages.
Jane Napier, a film critic, underlines the global impact of the movie. The movie''s theme is uncertainty. "I think this is one reason why this movie is so popular, it recognizes that the world can be scary, and that we don''t always know what''s going to happen to us," Napier explains.
To Yoshioka, a Studio Ghibli fan, Spirited Away can be interpreted in numerous ways by the viewer. "This is key for the film to be loved as a classic," he says. "So, even 20 years on, Spirited Away is a movie that can be watched and rewatched."'], ARRAY[E'whether anime movies would be suitable for the festival', E'other types of movies that are popular among secondary school students', E'other activities to organise for the festival', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you like anime movies?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What is your favourite animated movie?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you prefer animated or live-action movies?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think that anime movies can be for adults?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should all anime movies have a happy ending?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What type of movies make you want to watch them again?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What makes an anime movie appealing?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you agree anime movies have artistic value?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

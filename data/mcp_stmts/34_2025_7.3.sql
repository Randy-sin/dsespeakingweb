As artificial intelligence or ''AI'' becomes more widely used and starts replacing some traditional jobs, many young people worry about their future careers.
According to some experts, however, there is one popular job trend which will not be easily taken over by AI: being a ''personal shopper''.
A personal shopper refers to a person who helps customers find products that they need by doing their shopping for them. Instead of visiting real stores or spending hours searching online, a customer with little free time can find a personal shopper with the right skills, knowledge and connections to help meet their needs.
"This is a job that has grown quickly," says American business executive Tom Ward. "And it''s grown in line with the way that customers want to shop."
The best personal shoppers have expert knowledge of their field. To become a professional clothing shopper, for instance, you need to learn everything about fashion, from the top designer names to the latest fashion trends.
While AI assistants may also have such knowledge, the benefit of human shoppers is that when they visit stores to locate good quality or ''on sale'' items, they build personal relationships with store owners and supply shops. This can help a human shopper see the quality of the goods, get the best possible prices, and even find unusual products not available online. These benefits, say retail experts, mean that human personal shoppers are still the best choice.'], ARRAY[E'whether being a personal shopper would be a good job for teenagers', E'if AI will one day replace human salespeople in face-to-face shopping', E'how shopping will change in the future', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you like shopping?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Where is your favourite place to shop?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you prefer to shop alone or with friends?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you prefer shopping online or in a shop?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you be a good personal clothes shopper?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What do you think would be difficult about being a personal shopper?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you hire a personal shopper if you were too busy to shop yourself?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is shopping a leisure activity or a necessity?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

In 1985,a little Italian plumber became the face of video games, and changed the way we play them.''Super Mario Bros'' featured the main character in the game, Mario, jumping around collecting coins and rushing to save Princess Peach from a villainous turtle.
At the time, video games were usually created by computer engineers, as opposed to today''s artists.
"I was trying to use the technology available at the time to produce a distinctive-looking character from a small number of pixels, and that resulted in Mario," said Shigeru Miyamoto, the game designer and producer of Super Mario Bros. As to why he picked a 26-year-old Italian-American plumber from New York as the main character, Miyamoto said, "We wanted him to be someone who might live near you, and not a superhero."
"People had never seen a game like Super Mario Bros," said Frank Cifaldi, co-director of the Video Game History Foundation, "Super Mario Bros manages to convey an epic adventure in a massive world. Day turns to night as you progress. You cross bridges into new lands." Super Mario Bros changed the way we play video games - "from merely aiming for a high score to playing a game to experience an adventure and see it through to its ending,"he said.
To celebrate Super Mario''s 40th anniversary, Nintendo has launched Mario-centred games.

If you were trying to guess which social media sites are becoming popular among teenagers, what would you choose? Snapchat? Instagram? Facebook?
You might be surprised to learn that a growing number of high schoolers are now turning to a site that is all about success at work: LinkedIn.
The world''s largest online professional network, LinkedIn, helps people find the right jobs, connect with others in their field, make important professional connections and learn skills necessary for career success. It also allows users to join career-related discussions and to read, and comment on, articles from their field.
According to recent studies, many teenagers in North America now see LinkedIn as the hottest social media platform. This is partly because they are trying to prepare themselves for today''s fast-moving job market, but also because they like the positive tone of the site.
"When I go on Facebook,I just see people with horrible feelings and bad ideas," said one teenager. "And when I go on LinkedIn, it''s so positive and honest--this is how social media should be."
Many secondary students also say that they like LinkedIn because it helps them to find role models, to follow their interests, and to learn about possible future job trends.
"I had been interviewing teenagers about social media," said journalist Anya Kamenetz. "And I learned that this site is popular with those who are really focused on their futures.'], ARRAY[E'why teenagers may be turning away from other social media sites', E'whether social media is useful for finding career information', E'whether secondary school students should be concerned about their future careers', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you use social media?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Which social media sites are most popular among teenagers?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What job would you like to do in the future?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Which careers are most popular among teenagers nowadays?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you look for jobs on social media?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How do people in Hong Kong usually look for jobs?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you post your profile on social media to find a job?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How can you check if information on social media is trustworthy?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

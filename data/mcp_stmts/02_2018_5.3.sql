I refer to Nick Westra''s article "Why are so many Hongkongers moving to Taiwan?". I agree that a lot of people from Hong Kong are realising that Taiwan is the ideal place for them to settle down.
The living environment in Hong Kong is becoming more difficult. Costs keep rising in what is already one of the most expensive cities in the world, especially when it comes to property prices and rent. People have to work long hours to earn enough to cover living expenses. They don''t have enough time to spend with their families and are so tired that on Sundays they often sleep all day.
Life in the city is too hectic, and the workplace is too competitive.
However, the pace of life is much slower in Taiwan. I think you can enjoy a much less complicated way of life there and being away from the fierce competition in Hong Kong''s offices must be very liberating.
Families with children can have a good quality of life because, although the salaries are lower in Taiwan, the cost of living is also much lower.
While it is a big change in lifestyle, I am sure people who relocate to Taiwan will eventually adapt to living there and enjoy living there.

The Hong Kong Fire Services Department is seeking hundreds of recruits
As a member of the Hong Kong Fire Services Department (FSD), whose primary purpose it is to serve and protect the community, a Hong Kong firefighter has a challenging career. At the same time,being a firefighter offers a variety of career opportunities, is hugely rewarding and has an excellent starting salary ($18,000 per month).
The men and women of the FSD can be called upon to cover a range of incidents, including traffic and industrial accidents, gas leakages, landslides, flooding, building collapses, and even malfunctioning lifts
In the next year,the FSD is aiming to recruit 60 station officers and 160 firefighters.
"The first and most important question that anyone considering a career as a Hong Kong firefighter should ask themselves is:''Do I have the wholehearted willingness to serve the community?''," says Wong Ka-wing, divisional officer of the FSD''s recruitment, training and examination group. "Being a firefighter is about being trustworthy, and someone the public can always rely on in any situation."
Those wishing to be a firefighter have to complete a 36-week training programme. Then recruits are assigned to fire stations around Hong Kong to begin a three-year probation period. "On-the-job field training is very important because this is where recruits are dealing with real-life scenarios," says Wong. The FSD also provides public education and awareness training and carries out fire safety inspections on licensed premises.'], ARRAY[E'what skills and qualities are needed to be a good firefighter', E'the advantages and disadvantages of working as a firefighter', E'activities that you could organise to help students learn about the job', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Would you like to be a firefighter?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would your parents like you to become a firefighter?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What do you think is the worst part of being a firefighter?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think a high academic qualification is necessary to be a firefighter?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What do you think would be the best part of working for the Fire Services Department?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think the job of a firefighter is rewarding?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should duties be different for male and female firefighters?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Does Hong Kong society appreciate firefighters?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

By 2050 the population is expected to reach 9billion. To feed all of those hungry mouths, we will need to produce almost twice as much food as we currently do. But that isn''t going to be easy. One possible solution? Insects.
Eating insects is a common practice that''s been taking place for thousands of years. Around 2 billion people regularly eat insects as part of their diet, and over 1,900 species are edible. The most commonly eaten bugs are beetles, caterpillars, bees, wasps and ants.
So what''s so good about insects? Well, they''re nutritious and healthy. Insects actually have a high fat, protein, vitamin, fibre and mineral content that is often comparable to fish or livestock. Beetles, for example, contain on average 205 g/kg protein; beef contains 256 g/kg.
Raising insects as a source of food as opposed to farmed animals is more environmentally friendly. Insects require significantly less land and water than traditionally-farmed animals and also reproduce much more quickly. Additionally, insects produce a fraction of the greenhouse gases when compared with other livestock, particularly cattle. Finally, insect farming can provide jobs and income to people living in poor areas. Insects are sustainable, green, nutritious and could help people out of poverty.

I think that today''s teenagers have a very casual attitude towards material possessions. From the time they are born,they get what they want,even things that are not necessary.And yet they keep demanding more from their parents. It makes no sense to buy things without thinking about the price. What''s more, youngsters are easily affected by their peers. If their friends have something new and trendy, they will also want to have it. But they do not consider whether they really need it. Parents should not buy their children too many items that they do not really need. And they should teach them to treasure what they have. They have to set a good example. Young people need to exercise self-control.

More and more teenagers are turning to different forms of body art, such as tattooing and nose piercing, to establish their personal identity and look different. One of the main reasons young people decide to modify their bodies is to look cool. Teenagers want to express their individuality and have a strong desire to stand out from the crowd. This gives them a sense of uniqueness that makes them different from everyone else.
19-year-old James Keen is a typical example. He is one of the first in Hong Kong to have had the tip of his tongue split into two.''When I first saw it in some teen magazines,I thought tongue-splitting was the most beautiful thing I''d seen in my life,'' says James. Most of his friends do not know that he has had his tongue split unless he shows it to them.When asked how he felt about the splitting process, James said it did cause some pain for about a week, especially when he ate,but he believed it was worthwhile.''Piercing of the ears,nose and lips is just too common.I wanted something different.'''], ARRAY[E'why some teenagers like body art such as tattooing and nose piercing', E'the medical dangers of body art', E'how Hong Kong society views people with tattoos and their bodies pierced', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "What do you think of teenagers who have tattoos and body piercing?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why do teenagers think body art is ''cool?''", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do any of your friends have tattoos and body piercing?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you ever thought about having a tattoo or body piercing?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why is it important for teenagers to express their individuality?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How do adults and parents feel about teenagers who have body modifications?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do teenagers go too far with body modifications these days?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What do you think are the long term problems of having a tattoo?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What other ways do young people try to ''stand out'' from the crowd?", "number": 9, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What advice would you give to a friend who wanted a tattoo or some kind of body-piercing?", "number": 10, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

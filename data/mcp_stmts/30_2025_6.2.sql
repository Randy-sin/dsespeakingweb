For decades, French, Spanish, German and Japanese have been the most popular foreign languages among Hong Kong students. But in recent years, Korean has emerged as the new kid on the block. The latest estimate by the Korean consulate in Hong Kong showed that there were around 40,000 Korean learners in 2024 based on enrolment figures at universities and private academies.
In secondary schools, most Korean lessons are taught as extracurricular classes. But some have gone a step further to include the language in their curriculum as an elective. The introduction of Korean into the public school curriculum, although still at an early stage, is significant and a testament to its popularity, experts say. Professor Li Chor-Shing said the launching of Korean classes in public schools shows that many young people are motivated to learn Korean, and that it could help students with their future career prospects.
Teachers say Korean has gained popularity in public schools as young people see learning Korean as more than just a hobby. Ms. Lai, who has taught Korean for over 10 years, said she has seen a shift in the past two to three years in the reasons young people want to learn the language. "It used to be K-pop fans wanting to learn how to write ''Oppa, I love you'' in letters to their idols," Ms. Lai said. "But now, aside from that, students also see Korea as a study destination or they want to work there."'], ARRAY[E'why Hong Kong students should learn other languages', E'which other languages would be popular among students', E'how students can learn other languages outside the classroom', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Would you like to learn Korean?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you like Korean culture?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you prefer to learn languages online or at school?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is listening to songs useful for learning a language?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is it important to speak many languages to have a successful career?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you prefer learning an Asian or a European language?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think you will need to learn more languages in the future?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you need to know a country''s culture to learn its language?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

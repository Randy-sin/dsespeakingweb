14 years ago, when Zachary Grand turned 17, he couldn''t wait to get his driving licence. Back then, a driving licence was considered a sign of adulthood: you were not a child anymore and could travel around freely, not depending on anyone else.
How times have changed. While the share of US teenagers with a driving licence was over 65% in 1995, today it is below 40%. In cities that have good public transport, the percentage is even lower.
Grand notes that teens do not want to get their driving licences anymore. "When I recently moved from California to Chicago, I was really surprised to see that so few young people here want to drive. It''s incredible!"
The reasons behind this trend are many, and complicated. For one thing, car costs have increased a lot and so have the prices of petrol and insurance. Additionally, cities and towns have grown more crowded and less car-friendly, and many states in the US have made it harder for teenagers to get a driving licence.
Technology is also a factor. Things that teens used to do in person - hanging out with friends, taking classes, shopping for clothes, playing games - can now be done online. Ride-hailing apps like Uber and home delivery apps have also made driving less necessary.
"You can do anything from your phone," Grand says. "Call an Uber or even book a train or bus if you want to."'], ARRAY[E'the benefits and challenges of being a driver in Hong Kong', E'whether Hong Kong is a car-friendly city', E'reasons why so few teenagers learn to drive in Hong Kong', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you want to learn to drive?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do young people in Hong Kong usually learn to drive?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is Hong Kong a safe city for driving?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think schools should teach students how to drive?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think it is necessary for teenagers to learn to drive in Hong Kong?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should the government encourage more or less car ownership in Hong Kong?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should Hong Kong young people be allowed to drive at a younger age than 18 years old?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think that learning to drive is a sign of adulthood?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Have you heard of Chelonaphobia, or fear of turtles? Emily Ko, a Hong Kong-born freelance writer is scared of turtles, and while it sounds silly to most people, that''s exactly what a phobia is - an extreme fear of a threat and expecting danger that''s out of proportion to the actual risk.
"I was five years old when my parents came home with two pet turtles," Emily says. "I freaked out. Obviously, my parents didn''t throw away the turtles - they put them in my brother''s room. But these things live long lives...I didn''t go into that bedroom for 10 years."
Hong Kong-based hypnotherapist Sonia Samtani has dealt with a range of phobias - some common, some not. "I''ve treated people for fear of public speaking, cockroaches, needles, medical procedures, flying and dark spaces, and less common phobias such as cats, escalators, and pigeons." Samtani says phobias can also eat away at a person''s self-confidence and self-esteem. The impact may get more severe if that person doesn''t know why they are scared of something.
However, there are techniques that can help people overcome even the most extreme phobias. One popular type of treatment that helps people change the way they think and behave, is to gradually expose them to their fear so they feel less anxious about it. In this way, people don''t have to suffer from phobias all their lives.'], ARRAY[E'common fears that Hong Kong teenagers have', E'why they may have such fears', E'how they can overcome those fears', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "What things are you afraid of?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you know anybody who is scared of an animal?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Were you afraid of anything when you were younger?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why would some people be afraid of taking the lift?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How can you help a friend who has a fear of public speaking?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Where would you seek help if you had a fear of something?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How do people''s fears affect their self-confidence?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think some fears might disappear as you get older?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Hong Kong-based travel firm Vapido is continuing to promote attractions that feature wild animal performances despite a new animal welfare policy enacted last month. The company defended its tours and said it was committed to helping "build a responsible tourism community and improve the lives of animals in the travel industry."
"Our approach is to continually work with operators to encourage long-term and sustainable change, which not only takes into consideration animal welfare but also communities who are directly impacted by the industry," a company spokesperson said. "We continue to work with our partners across the world to achieve this. One example is elephant tourism in Thailand, which comes with a cultural and religious heritage, and is beneficial for the local communities and the economy,"she added.
Earlier this year, the travel company vowed to end ticketing for some animal attractions. Under its new policy, situations where wild animals are drugged or abused are banned. This ban extends to circuses and shows during which animals are forced to perform unnatural behaviour.
However, the animal welfare NGO, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, shared a video that showed dead bodies of horses and camels outside a tourist site in Egypt. While camel-riding activities in Egypt are listed as "currently unavailable" on Vapido''s website, the company continues to offer camel rides in places including Dubai, Morocco, and Turkey.'], ARRAY[E'types of tourist activities that involve animals', E'how these activities may cause harm to animals', E'possible benefits of these activities for animals and local communities', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Have you ever watched an animal show?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you enjoy animal shows?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you go on a camel ride?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How would you encourage people to treat animals better?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do animals used in shows have a better life?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why do people go to animal shows when on holiday?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should all animal shows be banned?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What can the government do to increase tourists'' awareness about animal welfare?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

When the British rock group The Beatles first visited America in 1964, it set off a musical explosion. Not only did this group become hugely popular around the world, but young people everywhere also started buying musical instruments and forming pop and rock groups of their own.
For the rest of the 20th century, music groups dominated the pop charts. In the year 2000, for instance, over 80% of the songs listed in the ''Hot 100'' biggest musical acts compiled by Billboard magazine were by pop,rock or hip-hop groups.
How times have changed. According to recent data, very few of the hottest songs from the year 2024 were from music groups. In August 2024, only one group, Imagine Dragons, had a hit in the Global Top 50. Individual performers like Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Eminem and Dua Lipa now dominate the charts.
While there are many reasons for this trend,experts say that the biggest factor has been the rise of social media. As music executive Chris Price notes, social media "is mainly a solo activity. It''s easier as an individual singer to express what kind of artist you are on YouTube or Instagram than for four people to do the same thing."
Another factor is the improved technology for recording music alone, as software like Ableton Live allows people to make high-quality music at home. "In the past, if you wanted to make music for people to dance to, you needed a band,"says Price. "Now you just need a laptop."'], ARRAY[E'whether music groups are popular in Hong Kong', E'whether it is better to watch a performance by a music group or an individual performer', E'how social media has affected pop music trends', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you like listening to music?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you like to be part of a music group?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do boys and girls usually like the same kinds of music?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should all children learn to play a musical instrument?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do teens usually prefer music from Hong Kong or music from other places?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do older and younger people in Hong Kong like the same kinds of music?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is music important to young people these days?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think music groups will completely disappear in the future?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

More often than not, we are busy with work, maintaining our friendships and checking in with our families. And as we enjoy taking care of others, it''s also important to take care of ourselves. Self-care is key to our physical and mental health.
"Self-care is when you engage in activities that take care of yourself," Valerie Ho, the founder of an e-commerce platform specializing in self-care products, explains. When we do not engage in self-care activities, "physically, we feel the symptoms of stress, things like increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, headaches, and stomach upsets. From a mental health perspective, there is an increase in anxiety or depression, and emotionally, people may find themselves more easily irritated or crying without any reason," says Odile Thiang from MindHK, an NGO focusing on wellbeing among Hong Kong people.
According to Odile, there are three pillars of self-care - exercise, sleep, and diet. Regular exercise is not only important for your physical health, but from a mental health perspective, it has been shown to treat feelings of anxiety and depression. Getting enough sleep is also an incredibly important part of self-care and helps us recharge. And watching what you eat is beneficial to both your body and your emotions.
If you don''t know where to start, Odile suggests trying coupling - pairing something you love with something you know is good for you, but you''re not too keen on. "A lot of people find it hard to get motivated about exercising, so couple it with watching your favourite Netflix show."'], ARRAY[E'whether Hong Kong students are aware of the importance of self-care', E'activities to organise during the Self-Care Month', E'ways to encourage students to take part in self-care activities', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you enjoy exercise?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think you get enough sleep?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What activities do you do if you feel stressed?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Does your school promote well-being among students?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do students in Hong Kong have enough time to do exercise?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think exercise can help improve mental health?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How can parents support their children''s well-being?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Who should be responsible for students'' health: schools or parents?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

In 2001, one of the most celebrated anime movies hit theatres in Japan. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli, Spirited Away would leave a mark on animation in the 21st century.
The story follows an ordinary 10-year-old girl, Chihiro, as she arrives at a deserted theme park that turns into a world of spirits at night. Her parents are turned into pigs by Yubaba, the witch who manages a bathhouse serving otherworldly customers. Chihiro must work in the bathhouse to save her parents and find a way to return home. The story is a tale of resilience,as Chihiro gradually finds her inner strength.
The movie arrived at a time when people thought animation was for children. Spirited Away destroyed prejudice about the art form and proved that a movie created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore could reach global audiences of all ages.
Jane Napier, a film critic, underlines the global impact of the movie. The movie''s theme is uncertainty. "I think this is one reason why this movie is so popular, it recognizes that the world can be scary, and that we don''t always know what''s going to happen to us," Napier explains.
To Yoshioka, a Studio Ghibli fan, Spirited Away can be interpreted in numerous ways by the viewer. "This is key for the film to be loved as a classic," he says. "So, even 20 years on, Spirited Away is a movie that can be watched and rewatched."'], ARRAY[E'whether anime movies would be suitable for the festival', E'other types of movies that are popular among secondary school students', E'other activities to organise for the festival', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you like anime movies?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What is your favourite animated movie?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you prefer animated or live-action movies?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think that anime movies can be for adults?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should all anime movies have a happy ending?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What type of movies make you want to watch them again?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What makes an anime movie appealing?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you agree anime movies have artistic value?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

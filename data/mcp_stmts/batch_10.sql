For decades, French, Spanish, German and Japanese have been the most popular foreign languages among Hong Kong students. But in recent years, Korean has emerged as the new kid on the block. The latest estimate by the Korean consulate in Hong Kong showed that there were around 40,000 Korean learners in 2024 based on enrolment figures at universities and private academies.
In secondary schools, most Korean lessons are taught as extracurricular classes. But some have gone a step further to include the language in their curriculum as an elective. The introduction of Korean into the public school curriculum, although still at an early stage, is significant and a testament to its popularity, experts say. Professor Li Chor-Shing said the launching of Korean classes in public schools shows that many young people are motivated to learn Korean, and that it could help students with their future career prospects.
Teachers say Korean has gained popularity in public schools as young people see learning Korean as more than just a hobby. Ms. Lai, who has taught Korean for over 10 years, said she has seen a shift in the past two to three years in the reasons young people want to learn the language. "It used to be K-pop fans wanting to learn how to write ''Oppa, I love you'' in letters to their idols," Ms. Lai said. "But now, aside from that, students also see Korea as a study destination or they want to work there."'], ARRAY[E'why Hong Kong students should learn other languages', E'which other languages would be popular among students', E'how students can learn other languages outside the classroom', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Would you like to learn Korean?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you like Korean culture?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you prefer to learn languages online or at school?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is listening to songs useful for learning a language?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is it important to speak many languages to have a successful career?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you prefer learning an Asian or a European language?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think you will need to learn more languages in the future?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you need to know a country''s culture to learn its language?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Thousands have taken up urban beekeeping in Sydney. The reaction from neighbours is not always positive. Rob Simms has three beehives in his garden, and gives away jars of honey to keep his neighbours sweet. "I delayed doing anything for six months because I thought I wouldn''t get neighbour approval," Simms said. "Now I give people jars of honey and everyone''s happy."
But the beekeeping boom has created problems for urban living. Catherine Heath, a resident, considers herself pro-bee. However, this spring her garden has become a no-go zone because of aggressive bees, and she noticed an adjoining house had a sign on the front fence advertising homegrown honey. "It''s to the point that in good weather, we can''t use the backyard most of the time" Heath says. "There are a lot of bees and they behave in a strange way. They attack both dogs and humans unprovoked."
Douglas Purdie, president of Sydney Bee Club, said this was not unheard of. "Bees, like all wild things, go through cycles and temperament, just like you can have a dog that''s very nice today and tomorrow bites you,"he said.
The Department of Primary Industries says Sydney has over 15,000 registered beekeepers and around 400,000 hives. Dr Tobias Smith, a researcher at the University of Queensland, comments that native Australian bees are stingless. "If you have flowers around, they will just do their own thing, and you sit back and enjoy watching them," Smith said. "They''re a really easy pet."'], ARRAY[E'benefits of beekeeping at school', E'problems that beekeeping could cause at school', E'other activities that could help students to learn about bees', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you like honey?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Are you scared of bees?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you like to have an insect as a pet?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you like to keep bees?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How can schools make beekeeping safe for students?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would your neighbours be upset if you took up beekeeping?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think Hong Kong is suitable for urban beekeeping?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How else can schools promote a connection with nature?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

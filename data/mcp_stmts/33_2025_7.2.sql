Anyone who has ever watched movies or TV shows should be familiar with subtitles.
These are words that are shown on the bottom or side of a screen to indicate what the speakers on screen are saying. For viewers to follow along with the story,the timing of the texts must be the same as the timing of the people speaking.
Originally, subtitles had two main purposes: to translate the words from a foreign language into your own language, and to allow people who have hearing problems to understand the words being spoken.
Recently, however, there has been a new trend among young people in the UK. According to research, 4 out of 5 viewers between the age of 18-25 use subtitles all the time - even when watching movies or TV shows in their own language - while less than 25% of people aged between 56-75 do so.
"I think it''s natural now for young people to accept subtitles," said UK media expert Melanie Sharpe. She added that while older people feel that using subtitles while listening to someone speak "requires too much thinking," young people "can take in far more information quickly because they''re used to it."
Nobody knows exactly how this trend started, but one theory is that young people grew up with seeing subtitles on social media and are now comfortable with them.
Another factor may be the poor sound quality of streamed videos. "They might be using subtitles because of background noise or changing volumes," Sharpe said.'], ARRAY[E'benefits of adding subtitles to the programmes', E'whether adding subtitles to programmes would be popular among students', E'type of programmes subtitles are not suitable for', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Is there a Campus TV channel at your school?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you usually use subtitles when watching movies?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you prefer English or Chinese subtitles?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Are movies without subtitles difficult to watch?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Are movies with subtitles less enjoyable?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you agree that young people like subtitles?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you prefer to have subtitles when watching a movie in your own language?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Can subtitles help people to learn a language?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

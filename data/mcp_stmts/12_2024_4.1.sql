Did you know most German students don''t want to go to university? Instead, vocational education and training (VET) is a very common pathway to gain skills and embark on a successful career. VET combines job-training and study, so students can both study and work at the same time. VET offers certifications for people who are interested in becoming an electrician, tax specialist, nurse, ambulance worker, dental technician, hairdresser, film and video editor, and product designer.
Depending on the job, trainees may work for three to four days a week in the company, factory, or shop to learn practical skills through on-the-job training. Trainees earn a modest salary which helps with student expenses.
On the other days, students go to school to learn both job-specific and general education subjects, such as English, maths, and physical education. The program usually lasts between two and four years. At the end of the training, students take an examination and are then given their certifications. They can continue to work in the place they were trained, study to obtain further qualifications or even become self-employed.
The VET program supplies Germany''s companies with well-trained employees. It also helps trainees transition into work life. VET opens up a variety of promising career options for young people.

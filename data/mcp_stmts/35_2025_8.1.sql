Carrying three lenses, two cameras and a tripod with him,Mainland Chinese tourist, Wei Qingyu, arrived at a basketball court with his girlfriend in search of a photo spot in Kennedy Town on a cloudy day. But why this sports facility in a residential area on Hong Kong Island?
Wei said it provided the perfect vantage point to capture the city''s historic trams going along a vibrant street against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour. It was a tip Wei saw on Xiaohongshu, an Instagram-like social media platform popular on the Mainland and beyond.
Xiaohongshu, known for travel tips, has more than 200 million active users, with more than 70 per cent of the users born in the 1990s. The app has reshaped Hong Kong''s tourism landscape, as influencers share ideas and tips for previously ordinary places. Some bring takeaways from McDonald''s to MacDonnell Road in Mid-Levels for a fun photo. Others flock to Yau Ma Tei Police Station for a shot of the iconic building.
Another destination popularised on Xiaohongshu is a busy footbridge in Mong Kok. Colourful neon signs adorning the residential buildings are a popular draw for tourists, who want to capture the nostalgic vintage vibe of Hong Kong.
"The scenery, with some background music, seems quite romantic," a Malaysian tourist said. "Hong Kong feels familiar because its dramas and films are very popular in Malaysia, and we go hunting for places we see on the app."'], ARRAY[E'famous places to include in the video', E'activities to show in the video', E'difficulties your group may face while making the video', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you like making videos?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you ever taken a photo at a famous place in Hong Kong?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you read travel tips on social media?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is social media useful for exploring Hong Kong?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What makes Hong Kong popular among tourists?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you follow any influencers who share travel tips?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What aspects of Hong Kong would you like to see on social media?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you agree influencers are important for promoting tourism?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

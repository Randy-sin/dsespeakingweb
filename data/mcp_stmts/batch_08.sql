The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a self-reported personality test that can help you find out what kind of person you are. Among other things,the test assesses people''s likes, dislikes, personal preferences, and possible career paths.
There are 16 personality types in total in the test. Many young people nowadays take the test to see if it can help them choose a suitable future job.
According to LinkedIn, a website that helps people find suitable careers, job seekers can use the MBTI test in multiple ways. First, it can help them identify their strengths, weaknesses, preferred work style, and ability to get along with others. Additionally, people can find lists online showing how common each MBTI type is in various fields of work,which can help them choose a career that matches their personality.
"By using the MBTI, you can discover your personality type and how it influences your work preferences, behaviours, and outcomes," the site reports. "You can also use the MBTI to find careers that match your type."
However,it is not only potential employees who use the MBTI but employers as well. In China, many companies, including large international ones, now require job applicants to complete the test, and it is one of the factors that may help them decide whether to hire someone-or not.
"Some companies may not want to hire someone whose personality test results do not suit their goals," said Ning, a senior media executive.'], ARRAY[E'benefits of using personality tests for choosing a career', E'problems with using personality tests for choosing a career', E'other ways to decide how to choose the right career', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "What job would you like to do?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you ever taken a personality test?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Are personality tests popular among young people in Hong Kong?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do your friends have similar personalities to you?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is it important to know your own personality type?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What kind of personality do you get along well with?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Has your personality changed since you were younger?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should employers be allowed to use personality tests?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Many Scout organizations worldwide have committed to achieving the United Nation''s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, the groups aim to end poverty, reduce inequality and combat climate change.
Learning key values
From as young as six, boys and girls can join to learn about nature while playing games, making friends and learning important values. "The key values of a Scout are respect for others, for oneself and for the environment" says Morgan, a Belgian Scout leader. In Greece, for example, Scouts are given tips on how they can implement the SDGs in their daily lives, such as by asking for a donation to charity instead of a gift on their birthday to achieve Goal 1: No Poverty; or by not letting their tap run when brushing their teeth for Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.
Everyone is welcome
Inclusion is an important principle of Scouting. "Everyone is welcome in Scouting. One of the most important values for young people taking part is that everyone can participate and that you can be yourself," says Takahashi, Director of Scouting Japan. "Cooking together at camp or sleeping in a tent promotes community life and respect for different opinions," says Luc, another Scout leader from Luxembourg.
Global solidarity
Scouting not only brings young people together at a national level, but also internationally. Thousands of young members from 171 countries meet every four years at the World Scout Jamboree. Held in a different location each time, the 10-day educational event promotes peace and friendship.'], ARRAY[E'benefits of Scouting for secondary school students', E'activities to organise for the club', E'ways to encourage other students to join the club', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you enjoy nature?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you like to be a Scout?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you ever gone camping?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you enjoy sleeping in a tent?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is camping a popular activity in Hong Kong?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you prefer camping in a Scout group or with your family?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you agree Scouts could make the world a better place?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What lessons that you learn as a Scout would be the most important?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Intricate bamboo scaffolding is still part of the cityscape in Hong Kong. The metropolis is one of the world''s last remaining cities to use bamboo scaffolding in construction and building repair. Luckily, the Construction Industry Council (CIC) and its students are keeping this sustainable skill alive.
Scaffolders perched on bamboo frames several storeys high are a common sight, and are nicknamed ''spiders'' by Hong Kong people for their agility over the scaffold.
Mo Jia Yu wraps his legs around a pole to balance high above the ground and secure a joint, a skill he must master to become a bamboo scaffolder in Hong Kong. "You have to have a daring heart," says Mo, one of dozens of students who enrol each year at the CIC to learn the traditional method. "You need courage as well as skill to survive,"says Professor Chang from the Architecture Department of the University of Hong Kong. "This discourages people from going into the industry."
Despite the dangers involved in the craft, Chang hopes Hong Kong will preserve it as part of its cultural heritage.
Bamboo is readily available across the border in southern Chinese provinces. Its price and efficiency makes it popular, while lightweight bamboo is also easier to transport through a cramped urban centre.
"Bamboo scaffolds are suited to the odd and tight spaces in Hong Kong," adds instructor Kin Kee Wo, who has worked in the construction industry for nearly 30 years.

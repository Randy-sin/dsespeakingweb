I think that today''s teenagers have a very casual attitude towards material possessions. From the time they are born,they get what they want,even things that are not necessary.And yet they keep demanding more from their parents. It makes no sense to buy things without thinking about the price. What''s more, youngsters are easily affected by their peers. If their friends have something new and trendy, they will also want to have it. But they do not consider whether they really need it. Parents should not buy their children too many items that they do not really need. And they should teach them to treasure what they have. They have to set a good example. Young people need to exercise self-control.

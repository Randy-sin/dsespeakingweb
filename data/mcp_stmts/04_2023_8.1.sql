By 2050 the population is expected to reach 9billion. To feed all of those hungry mouths, we will need to produce almost twice as much food as we currently do. But that isn''t going to be easy. One possible solution? Insects.
Eating insects is a common practice that''s been taking place for thousands of years. Around 2 billion people regularly eat insects as part of their diet, and over 1,900 species are edible. The most commonly eaten bugs are beetles, caterpillars, bees, wasps and ants.
So what''s so good about insects? Well, they''re nutritious and healthy. Insects actually have a high fat, protein, vitamin, fibre and mineral content that is often comparable to fish or livestock. Beetles, for example, contain on average 205 g/kg protein; beef contains 256 g/kg.
Raising insects as a source of food as opposed to farmed animals is more environmentally friendly. Insects require significantly less land and water than traditionally-farmed animals and also reproduce much more quickly. Additionally, insects produce a fraction of the greenhouse gases when compared with other livestock, particularly cattle. Finally, insect farming can provide jobs and income to people living in poor areas. Insects are sustainable, green, nutritious and could help people out of poverty.

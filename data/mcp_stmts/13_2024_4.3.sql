Hong Kong is ''fragrant harbour'' in Cantonese. There are actually many different smells, not necessarily pleasant and fragrant, that can make people think of this city. The following are some examples.
Money
Hong Kong is a financial centre in Asia. It is no surprise that the smell of money, both banknotes and coins, is a symbolic smell of the city.
Seafood
One never forgets the strong smell of dried seafood in Sheung Wan and the smell of shrimp paste in Sai Kung. All over Hong Kong, in wet markets, the odour of fish stalls is another reminder of how close Hong Kong is to the sea.
Joss sticks and incense
In Chinese temples, burning joss sticks and incense gives off a relaxing and woody fragrance that reflects the cultural roots of Hong Kong.
Street food
Hong Kong people love street food, particularly food that has strong flavours and smells: curry fish balls, stinky tofu, egg tarts and fried chestnuts.
Exhaust fumes on the road
Unpleasant as it may be, the smell of the exhaust gases from cars, lorries and buses all year round just reflects the busy traffic and the energy of the city.
Greenery
Contrary to most people''s first impression, 75 percent of Hong Kong''s territory is actually green: country parks, agricultural or semi-rural land. The refreshing and calming scents of trees and grass always offer escape from the stress of city life.'], ARRAY[E'why introducing Hong Kong through smells is a good idea', E'which three smells best represent Hong Kong and why', E'ways to attract visitors to your stall', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "What is your favourite smell?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What smell do you hate most?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What smells remind you of your school?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What smell do you like most in nature?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What smells remind you of your home?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you buy something because it smells good?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should foods that have strong smells be banned in public areas?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should movies incorporate smell in their production?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a self-reported personality test that can help you find out what kind of person you are. Among other things,the test assesses people''s likes, dislikes, personal preferences, and possible career paths.
There are 16 personality types in total in the test. Many young people nowadays take the test to see if it can help them choose a suitable future job.
According to LinkedIn, a website that helps people find suitable careers, job seekers can use the MBTI test in multiple ways. First, it can help them identify their strengths, weaknesses, preferred work style, and ability to get along with others. Additionally, people can find lists online showing how common each MBTI type is in various fields of work,which can help them choose a career that matches their personality.
"By using the MBTI, you can discover your personality type and how it influences your work preferences, behaviours, and outcomes," the site reports. "You can also use the MBTI to find careers that match your type."
However,it is not only potential employees who use the MBTI but employers as well. In China, many companies, including large international ones, now require job applicants to complete the test, and it is one of the factors that may help them decide whether to hire someone-or not.
"Some companies may not want to hire someone whose personality test results do not suit their goals," said Ning, a senior media executive.'], ARRAY[E'benefits of using personality tests for choosing a career', E'problems with using personality tests for choosing a career', E'other ways to decide how to choose the right career', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "What job would you like to do?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you ever taken a personality test?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Are personality tests popular among young people in Hong Kong?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do your friends have similar personalities to you?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is it important to know your own personality type?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What kind of personality do you get along well with?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Has your personality changed since you were younger?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should employers be allowed to use personality tests?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

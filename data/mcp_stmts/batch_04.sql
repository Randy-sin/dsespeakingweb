Did you know most German students don''t want to go to university? Instead, vocational education and training (VET) is a very common pathway to gain skills and embark on a successful career. VET combines job-training and study, so students can both study and work at the same time. VET offers certifications for people who are interested in becoming an electrician, tax specialist, nurse, ambulance worker, dental technician, hairdresser, film and video editor, and product designer.
Depending on the job, trainees may work for three to four days a week in the company, factory, or shop to learn practical skills through on-the-job training. Trainees earn a modest salary which helps with student expenses.
On the other days, students go to school to learn both job-specific and general education subjects, such as English, maths, and physical education. The program usually lasts between two and four years. At the end of the training, students take an examination and are then given their certifications. They can continue to work in the place they were trained, study to obtain further qualifications or even become self-employed.
The VET program supplies Germany''s companies with well-trained employees. It also helps trainees transition into work life. VET opens up a variety of promising career options for young people.

Hong Kong is ''fragrant harbour'' in Cantonese. There are actually many different smells, not necessarily pleasant and fragrant, that can make people think of this city. The following are some examples.
Money
Hong Kong is a financial centre in Asia. It is no surprise that the smell of money, both banknotes and coins, is a symbolic smell of the city.
Seafood
One never forgets the strong smell of dried seafood in Sheung Wan and the smell of shrimp paste in Sai Kung. All over Hong Kong, in wet markets, the odour of fish stalls is another reminder of how close Hong Kong is to the sea.
Joss sticks and incense
In Chinese temples, burning joss sticks and incense gives off a relaxing and woody fragrance that reflects the cultural roots of Hong Kong.
Street food
Hong Kong people love street food, particularly food that has strong flavours and smells: curry fish balls, stinky tofu, egg tarts and fried chestnuts.
Exhaust fumes on the road
Unpleasant as it may be, the smell of the exhaust gases from cars, lorries and buses all year round just reflects the busy traffic and the energy of the city.
Greenery
Contrary to most people''s first impression, 75 percent of Hong Kong''s territory is actually green: country parks, agricultural or semi-rural land. The refreshing and calming scents of trees and grass always offer escape from the stress of city life.'], ARRAY[E'why introducing Hong Kong through smells is a good idea', E'which three smells best represent Hong Kong and why', E'ways to attract visitors to your stall', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "What is your favourite smell?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What smell do you hate most?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What smells remind you of your school?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What smell do you like most in nature?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What smells remind you of your home?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you buy something because it smells good?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should foods that have strong smells be banned in public areas?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should movies incorporate smell in their production?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

How many years must a fencer train before he can call himself an Olympic champion? Edgar Cheung Ka-long, Hong Kong''s double Olympic champion would know.
In fact, Cheung didn''t take up fencing until he was 10 years old. "All the basketball classes were closed during the summer,"he recalls. "My father asked if I would be interested in a fencing course. I still remember it was a summer course for beginners. We practised footwork but that was all. Towards the end of the course,the teacher asked if anybody would like to try it with a real fence. Many of my classmates raised their hands, but I was too shy to do it in front of people. Even today, I would still consider myself an introvert. I''m not used to presenting myself during public appearances," he explains.
Cheung made his Olympic debut at the 2016 Rio Games. At the 2018 Asian Games, he helped Hong Kong win a silver medal in the team event. In Tokyo, his incredible run to gold included an unbelievable victory against his Italian rival in the final match. Finally, in Paris, he became the first Hong Kong athlete to win consecutive Olympic gold medals.
"I am happy to have won the Olympic gold medals. This is the dream of every athlete," Cheung says. "But more importantly the gold medal has made a great impact on society, ensuring more Hong Kong people know about fencing and more youngsters are willing to take up the sport."'], ARRAY[E'how his visit can benefit students', E'questions to ask him during the interview', E'other activities you could do on his visit', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "What sports do you enjoy watching?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you watched the Olympic games on TV?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you ever learned a sport during the summer holiday?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think fencing is dangerous?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What qualities are needed to be a professional athlete?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How has Cheung''s success influenced Hong Kong people?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How can more youngsters be encouraged to become professional athletes?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should the government invest more in producing elite athletes?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

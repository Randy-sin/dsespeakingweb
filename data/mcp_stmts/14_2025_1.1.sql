How many years must a fencer train before he can call himself an Olympic champion? Edgar Cheung Ka-long, Hong Kong''s double Olympic champion would know.
In fact, Cheung didn''t take up fencing until he was 10 years old. "All the basketball classes were closed during the summer,"he recalls. "My father asked if I would be interested in a fencing course. I still remember it was a summer course for beginners. We practised footwork but that was all. Towards the end of the course,the teacher asked if anybody would like to try it with a real fence. Many of my classmates raised their hands, but I was too shy to do it in front of people. Even today, I would still consider myself an introvert. I''m not used to presenting myself during public appearances," he explains.
Cheung made his Olympic debut at the 2016 Rio Games. At the 2018 Asian Games, he helped Hong Kong win a silver medal in the team event. In Tokyo, his incredible run to gold included an unbelievable victory against his Italian rival in the final match. Finally, in Paris, he became the first Hong Kong athlete to win consecutive Olympic gold medals.
"I am happy to have won the Olympic gold medals. This is the dream of every athlete," Cheung says. "But more importantly the gold medal has made a great impact on society, ensuring more Hong Kong people know about fencing and more youngsters are willing to take up the sport."'], ARRAY[E'how his visit can benefit students', E'questions to ask him during the interview', E'other activities you could do on his visit', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "What sports do you enjoy watching?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you watched the Olympic games on TV?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you ever learned a sport during the summer holiday?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think fencing is dangerous?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What qualities are needed to be a professional athlete?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How has Cheung''s success influenced Hong Kong people?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How can more youngsters be encouraged to become professional athletes?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should the government invest more in producing elite athletes?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

We often take photos of such aspects of everyday life as scenery and food, and we see others posting these kinds of pictures on social media. In some places, however, people are pushing back against this trend.
Vermont, USA
Officials in this town recently voted to close its roads in autumn, when the leaves of the trees turn colour and the area is at its most beautiful. Hundreds of tourists began going there to take photos, and many were parking near people''s private homes, damaging property and even arguing with local residents. "Traffic in this area has steadily increased, causing environmental, safety, and quality of life issues,"the town reported.
Mount Fuji, Japan
In May 2024, a Japanese town built a wall to block views of Mount Fuji, Japan''s most famous mountain. Large groups of tourists started going there to take photos and refused to obey rules on throwing trash and parking. One resident said,"When visitors don''t respect rules, leave litter behind and ignore traffic regulations, then as regrettable as it is, we have to take action."
Berlin, Germany
Before opening N&S, one of Germany''s top-rated restaurants, owner Billy Wagner set a ''no photos, no videos'' rule for the place. He mentions two reasons for the rule: privacy for the other diners and appreciation for the food. "I was interested in analogue focus, which is what a restaurant visit is really all about: to smell, taste, feel, see." He felt that the only way that people could have that focus was to put their phones away.'], ARRAY[E'why people might not like others taking photos in public places', E'places in Hong Kong that are popular for taking photos', E'whether Hong Kong needs to have rules for photo taking in public places', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you like taking photos?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you like to share photos with friends?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is taking photos a popular hobby among teenagers?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you ever gone to a place just to take photos?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is taking photos an important part of travelling?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Who likes taking photos more: younger people or older people?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Can taking photos spoil an experience?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think tourism causes disruption to local people?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

During the 1990s, as personal computers or ''PCs'' - including desktops and laptop computers - became more user-friendly, ownership of these devices increased dramatically. In the US, households owning a PC rose from 15%in1990 to 35%in1997.As the internet became more popular and usable, ownership continued to rise, and by 2007, about 271 million people worldwide owned a PC.
VS
In that same year, something incredible happened. Apple released the iPhone, the world''s first modern smartphone. That year, 124 million smartphones were sold;, within four years, smartphone sales surpassed those of PCs.By 2015, sales of smartphones were nearly five times higher than those of PCs.
Although PC ownership received a brief boost during the Covid-19 pandemic, when many people had to work from home, that was short-lived. In 2022, sales of PCs dropped by 20% from the previous year, and worldwide PC sales fell again in 2023 and 2024. Smartphone sales, meanwhile, have been rising by about 10% year on year, and by 2024,nearly 60% of all web traffic was from mobile devices.
Does this mean that the PC is dead? Not quite, say analysts. For people who work mostly in one place, for instance, a PC is more convenient, and for gamers who play high-end video games that require a lot of power, PCs are clearly better than phones.

Many will have noted the growing trend of Hong Kong residents travelling north to Shenzhen. The activities on these trips may include leisure activities and even medical services.
According to the latest data from the Immigration Department, 53 million trips were made by Hong Kong residents heading north in 2023. Since 2019, the consumption pattern of Hong Kong people in Shenzhen has gradually shifted from spending on leisure activities to everyday purchases, from dining and entertainment to medical check-ups, grocery shopping and even real estate purchases.
Take supermarket shopping as an example. Sam''s Club in Shenzhen has recently become a hit among families from Hong Kong. During weekends and holidays, it is common to see Hong Kong people stocking up on groceries and also enjoying dining after shopping.
Aaron Chan spent his New Year holidays in Shenzhen, during which he tried hot pot and barbecue and drank a lot of milk tea. "The cost of a good meal is half the price. In Shenzhen, you are spoilt for choice and the fruit and vegetables are much cheaper,"he stated.
Apart from being cheaper and the variety it offers, Shenzhen is attracting more people because of its high-quality services. A visitor from Hong Kong, Sally Wu, said that she had noticed great improvements in the quality of service in Shenzhen over the last few years. "For example, service staff there will proactively inform you about discount offers, and their friendly attitude makes you feel comfortable," she added.'], ARRAY[E'why trips to Shenzhen are becoming popular', E'why some Hong Kong people prefer Shenzhen to other places', E'how Hong Kong businesses could keep people in the city during holidays', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "What do you do at weekends?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you ever been to Shenzhen?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you like to travel to Shenzhen with your family?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What would you do on a family trip to Shenzhen?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think the trend of Hong Kong people travelling to Shenzhen will continue?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Apart from going to Shenzhen, how could Hong Kong people spend their free time?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think it is convenient to make everyday purchases in Shenzhen?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How will the travel habits of Hong Kong people change in the future?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

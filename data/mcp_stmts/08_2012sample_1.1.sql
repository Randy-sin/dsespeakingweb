Members of the media often complain that the government limits their freedom of expression, though many members of the public feel there is nothing wrong with this. Some years ago, photographs of Twins singer Gillian Chung Yan-tung were published by a local magazine, Easy Finder, and they caused a real storm. The photographs were taken with a hidden camera as she was changing costumes backstage. Many people were upset by this and demanded that press freedom be restricted. The Hong Kong Performing Artists Guild condemned the incident, and insisted the government amend the law and punish the magazine''s owners.
''Some people thought that the whole episode had been exaggerated, but people buy these magazines for exactly this kind of shocking content so it''s the market itself that demands such pictures,'' explained retired editor John Peters.

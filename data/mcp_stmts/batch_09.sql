Teenagers now have another thing to worry about: coffee. This time, it isn''t parents trying to prohibit their kids from becoming over-caffeinated: it''s Caligula Coffee, one of the largest coffee chains in the UK.
An employee''s recent refusal to serve an iced coffee to a 12-year-old is reigniting a controversial question. Should shops be allowed to ban the sale of coffee and energy drinks to teenagers and kids?
While Caligula Coffee isn''t completely banning the sale of coffee to teenagers, the company''s new policy allows its employees to deny serving them drinks that contain caffeine, including energy drinks. "We do not encourage the sale of caffeine to children under 16," the company''s spokesperson said. Some customers, including the 12-year-old''s father, are upset. He expressed his outrage online saying his daughter just deserved a treat.
But not everyone is against a ban. The UK government, for example, has been working to prohibit the sale of coffee and energy drinks to teenagers after declaring the link between caffeine consumption and various health issues among younger consumers too strong to ignore.
The National Institute of Health (NIH) says that significant amounts of caffeine affect the heart and blood vessels. According to Dr George of the NIH, when it comes to teenagers and caffeine, education and moderation are both key.And it''s also important to remember who you''re talking to. "Beware once you tell someone, especially teenagers, that they can''t have something: they will find a way to get their hands on it."'], ARRAY[E'negative effects of coffee and energy drinks on teenagers'' health', E'what the club can do to make those effects known among students', E'whether coffee and energy drinks should be sold to teenagers', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you like energy drinks?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What drinks are popular among teenagers?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do young people drink more coffee than old people?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you believe the coffee ban for teenagers is a good idea?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should schools ban unhealthy drinks?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What advice could you give a parent whose child drinks too many energy drinks?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What can be done to help teenagers consume fewer energy drinks?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you agree that banning something is not likely to work with teenagers?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Students always face many tests and exams. Taking a break from studies for a year and having a rest sounds attractive. A "Gap year", usually taken after the end of secondary school and before starting university, provides an opportunity for students to explore the world, look for a richer spiritual life and exchange cultural ideas.
What did Hong Kong students do during their gap years? Oscar Chan Chi-kin, a year one business student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, didn''t go to university immediately. Instead, he went to Singapore in his gap year and volunteered to help young people develop leadership skills. "Instead of being career-driven, I hoped to gain a life direction and figure out what I love to do," he said. After the gap year,he knew what his ideal working environment would look like in his future career. "Whether the company vision aligns with my personal values is really important."
Besides travelling and volunteering, young people from Asia also choose to intern and work to enrich their resumés and sharpen their competitive edge. However, Sascha Choi On, a student who has just started studying at CUHK has a different view: "Nowadays it''s changing. Some of my friends took a gap year because they really wanted to find a sense of self, such as ''who I am'' and ''what the goal in my life is''. Some students really care about their inner peace and happiness rather than just focusing on earning money"she said.'], ARRAY[E'benefits of taking a gap year', E'challenges of taking a gap year', E'activities young people could do during a gap year', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Would you like to take a gap year?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What would you do during a gap year?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you prefer to volunteer or to travel during a gap year?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Where would you like to travel to during a gap year?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you know what career you would like to pursue?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think taking a gap year is popular among Hong Kong young people?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How can students make sure that their gap year is not wasted?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How would travelling during a gap year help somebody''s career?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Redress, an NGO promoting sustainability through popularising second-hand fashion,is back with its seasonal "Get Redressed #ShopSecondhand" pop-up store in Hong Kong. Located at Taikoo Place, Quarry Bay, the second-hand pop-up store''s success over the years shows a growing second-hand culture in the city. Meanwhile, online second-hand luxury fashion platforms like Hula, Vestiaire Collective and Little Dot Vintage sell discounted items from brands like Dior, Chanel, and Gucci.
Shoppers can expect to see donated second-hand clothes and accessories from all over Hong Kong, with pieces ranging from luxury designer labels to more trendy and affordable ones, according to Redress'' event page. The clothing items up for resale are donated by people and collected through the NGO''s takeback program. With something for everyone, the event is expected to be size- and gender-inclusive, while shoppers will be confident that they are reducing their carbon footprint by buying second-hand clothes that would otherwise end up in the city''s landfills.
According to Redress'' 2020 study on Hong Kong''s fashion consumption, changes in consumer habits were considerable after the pandemic,with two out of three actively changing their behaviour, and 30 per cent of respondents acknowledging the environmental cost of shopping habits. What is particularly interesting is that 31 per cent of respondents already own second-hand clothing, while 12 per cent have been reselling clothes online and offline as well There is no doubt about the sustainable fashion industry''s potential in Hong Kong.'], ARRAY[E'what Hong Kong people normally do with their unwanted clothes', E'why second-hand fashion is growing in Hong Kong', E'ways to promote second-hand fashion', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you like shopping for clothes?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you like to wear second-hand clothes?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think buying second-hand clothing is a good idea?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What do you do with the clothes you no longer need?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why do some people think second-hand clothing is not a good idea?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you be concerned about the cleanliness of second-hand clothes?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why do people throw their clothes away so often?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How has the pandemic changed clothes shopping in Hong Kong?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

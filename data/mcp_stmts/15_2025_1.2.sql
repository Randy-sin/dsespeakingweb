We often take photos of such aspects of everyday life as scenery and food, and we see others posting these kinds of pictures on social media. In some places, however, people are pushing back against this trend.
Vermont, USA
Officials in this town recently voted to close its roads in autumn, when the leaves of the trees turn colour and the area is at its most beautiful. Hundreds of tourists began going there to take photos, and many were parking near people''s private homes, damaging property and even arguing with local residents. "Traffic in this area has steadily increased, causing environmental, safety, and quality of life issues,"the town reported.
Mount Fuji, Japan
In May 2024, a Japanese town built a wall to block views of Mount Fuji, Japan''s most famous mountain. Large groups of tourists started going there to take photos and refused to obey rules on throwing trash and parking. One resident said,"When visitors don''t respect rules, leave litter behind and ignore traffic regulations, then as regrettable as it is, we have to take action."
Berlin, Germany
Before opening N&S, one of Germany''s top-rated restaurants, owner Billy Wagner set a ''no photos, no videos'' rule for the place. He mentions two reasons for the rule: privacy for the other diners and appreciation for the food. "I was interested in analogue focus, which is what a restaurant visit is really all about: to smell, taste, feel, see." He felt that the only way that people could have that focus was to put their phones away.'], ARRAY[E'why people might not like others taking photos in public places', E'places in Hong Kong that are popular for taking photos', E'whether Hong Kong needs to have rules for photo taking in public places', E'anything else you think is important'], '[{"text": "Do you like taking photos?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you like to share photos with friends?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is taking photos a popular hobby among teenagers?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you ever gone to a place just to take photos?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is taking photos an important part of travelling?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Who likes taking photos more: younger people or older people?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Can taking photos spoil an experience?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think tourism causes disruption to local people?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

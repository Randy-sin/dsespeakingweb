During the 1990s, as personal computers or ''PCs'' - including desktops and laptop computers - became more user-friendly, ownership of these devices increased dramatically. In the US, households owning a PC rose from 15%in1990 to 35%in1997.As the internet became more popular and usable, ownership continued to rise, and by 2007, about 271 million people worldwide owned a PC.
VS
In that same year, something incredible happened. Apple released the iPhone, the world''s first modern smartphone. That year, 124 million smartphones were sold;, within four years, smartphone sales surpassed those of PCs.By 2015, sales of smartphones were nearly five times higher than those of PCs.
Although PC ownership received a brief boost during the Covid-19 pandemic, when many people had to work from home, that was short-lived. In 2022, sales of PCs dropped by 20% from the previous year, and worldwide PC sales fell again in 2023 and 2024. Smartphone sales, meanwhile, have been rising by about 10% year on year, and by 2024,nearly 60% of all web traffic was from mobile devices.
Does this mean that the PC is dead? Not quite, say analysts. For people who work mostly in one place, for instance, a PC is more convenient, and for gamers who play high-end video games that require a lot of power, PCs are clearly better than phones.
In the end, analysts say, the device you choose to use is the one that works best for you.'],ARRAY[E'why smartphones are so popular', E'whether PCs are still useful for students', E'whether smartphones will one day completely replace PCs', E'anything else you think is important'],'[{"text": "Do you use a smartphone?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you ever use a computer for homework?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do teenagers in Hong Kong spend too much time on their smartphones?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think that you could live without a smartphone?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should students be allowed to use smartphones in school?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think schools should provide laptops for students?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you prefer to work on a PC or smartphone?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should very young children be allowed to use a smartphone?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb,'2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00','2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Many will have noted the growing trend of Hong Kong residents travelling north to Shenzhen. The activities on these trips may include leisure activities and even medical services.
According to the latest data from the Immigration Department, 53 million trips were made by Hong Kong residents heading north in 2023. Since 2019, the consumption pattern of Hong Kong people in Shenzhen has gradually shifted from spending on leisure activities to everyday purchases, from dining and entertainment to medical check-ups, grocery shopping and even real estate purchases.
Take supermarket shopping as an example. Sam''s Club in Shenzhen has recently become a hit among families from Hong Kong. During weekends and holidays, it is common to see Hong Kong people stocking up on groceries and also enjoying dining after shopping.
Aaron Chan spent his New Year holidays in Shenzhen, during which he tried hot pot and barbecue and drank a lot of milk tea. "The cost of a good meal is half the price. In Shenzhen, you are spoilt for choice and the fruit and vegetables are much cheaper,"he stated.
Apart from being cheaper and the variety it offers, Shenzhen is attracting more people because of its high-quality services. A visitor from Hong Kong, Sally Wu, said that she had noticed great improvements in the quality of service in Shenzhen over the last few years.

14 years ago, when Zachary Grand turned 17, he couldn''t wait to get his driving licence. Back then, a driving licence was considered a sign of adulthood: you were not a child anymore and could travel around freely, not depending on anyone else.
How times have changed. While the share of US teenagers with a driving licence was over 65% in 1995, today it is below 40%. In cities that have good public transport, the percentage is even lower.
Grand notes that teens do not want to get their driving licences anymore. "When I recently moved from California to Chicago, I was really surprised to see that so few young people here want to drive. It''s incredible!"
The reasons behind this trend are many, and complicated. For one thing, car costs have increased a lot and so have the prices of petrol and insurance. Additionally, cities and towns have grown more crowded and less car-friendly, and many states in the US have made it harder for teenagers to get a driving licence.
Technology is also a factor. Things that teens used to do in person - hanging out with friends, taking classes, shopping for clothes, playing games - can now be done online. Ride-hailing apps like Uber and home delivery apps have also made driving less necessary.

Have you heard of Chelonaphobia, or fear of turtles? Emily Ko, a Hong Kong-born freelance writer is scared of turtles, and while it sounds silly to most people, that''s exactly what a phobia is - an extreme fear of a threat and expecting danger that''s out of proportion to the actual risk.
"I was five years old when my parents came home with two pet turtles," Emily says. "I freaked out. Obviously, my parents didn''t throw away the turtles - they put them in my brother''s room. But these things live long lives...I didn''t go into that bedroom for 10 years."
Hong Kong-based hypnotherapist Sonia Samtani has dealt with a range of phobias - some common, some not. "I''ve treated people for fear of public speaking, cockroaches, needles, medical procedures, flying and dark spaces, and less common phobias such as cats, escalators, and pigeons." Samtani says phobias can also eat away at a person''s self-confidence and self-esteem. The impact may get more severe if that person doesn''t know why they are scared of something.
However, there are techniques that can help people overcome even the most extreme phobias. One popular type of treatment that helps people change the way they think and behave, is to gradually expose them to their fear so they feel less anxious about it. In this way, people don''t have to suffer from phobias all their lives.'],ARRAY[E'common fears that Hong Kong teenagers have', E'why they may have such fears', E'how they can overcome those fears', E'anything else you think is important'],'[{"text": "What things are you afraid of?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you know anybody who is scared of an animal?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Were you afraid of anything when you were younger?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why would some people be afraid of taking the lift?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How can you help a friend who has a fear of public speaking?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Where would you seek help if you had a fear of something?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How do people''s fears affect their self-confidence?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think some fears might disappear as you get older?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb,'2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00','2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Hong Kong-based travel firm Vapido is continuing to promote attractions that feature wild animal performances despite a new animal welfare policy enacted last month. The company defended its tours and said it was committed to helping "build a responsible tourism community and improve the lives of animals in the travel industry."
"Our approach is to continually work with operators to encourage long-term and sustainable change, which not only takes into consideration animal welfare but also communities who are directly impacted by the industry," a company spokesperson said. "We continue to work with our partners across the world to achieve this. One example is elephant tourism in Thailand, which comes with a cultural and religious heritage, and is beneficial for the local communities and the economy,"she added.
Earlier this year, the travel company vowed to end ticketing for some animal attractions. Under its new policy, situations where wild animals are drugged or abused are banned. This ban extends to circuses and shows during which animals are forced to perform unnatural behaviour.
However, the animal welfare NGO, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, shared a video that showed dead bodies of horses and camels outside a tourist site in Egypt.

When the British rock group The Beatles first visited America in 1964, it set off a musical explosion. Not only did this group become hugely popular around the world, but young people everywhere also started buying musical instruments and forming pop and rock groups of their own.
For the rest of the 20th century, music groups dominated the pop charts. In the year 2000, for instance, over 80% of the songs listed in the ''Hot 100'' biggest musical acts compiled by Billboard magazine were by pop,rock or hip-hop groups.
How times have changed. According to recent data, very few of the hottest songs from the year 2024 were from music groups. In August 2024, only one group, Imagine Dragons, had a hit in the Global Top 50. Individual performers like Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Eminem and Dua Lipa now dominate the charts.
While there are many reasons for this trend,experts say that the biggest factor has been the rise of social media. As music executive Chris Price notes, social media "is mainly a solo activity. It''s easier as an individual singer to express what kind of artist you are on YouTube or Instagram than for four people to do the same thing."
Another factor is the improved technology for recording music alone, as software like Ableton Live allows people to make high-quality music at home.

More often than not, we are busy with work, maintaining our friendships and checking in with our families. And as we enjoy taking care of others, it''s also important to take care of ourselves. Self-care is key to our physical and mental health.
"Self-care is when you engage in activities that take care of yourself," Valerie Ho, the founder of an e-commerce platform specializing in self-care products, explains. When we do not engage in self-care activities, "physically, we feel the symptoms of stress, things like increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, headaches, and stomach upsets. From a mental health perspective, there is an increase in anxiety or depression, and emotionally, people may find themselves more easily irritated or crying without any reason," says Odile Thiang from MindHK, an NGO focusing on wellbeing among Hong Kong people.
According to Odile, there are three pillars of self-care - exercise, sleep, and diet. Regular exercise is not only important for your physical health, but from a mental health perspective, it has been shown to treat feelings of anxiety and depression. Getting enough sleep is also an incredibly important part of self-care and helps us recharge. And watching what you eat is beneficial to both your body and your emotions.
If you don''t know where to start, Odile suggests trying coupling - pairing something you love with something you know is good for you, but you''re not too keen on.

In 2001, one of the most celebrated anime movies hit theatres in Japan. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli, Spirited Away would leave a mark on animation in the 21st century.
The story follows an ordinary 10-year-old girl, Chihiro, as she arrives at a deserted theme park that turns into a world of spirits at night. Her parents are turned into pigs by Yubaba, the witch who manages a bathhouse serving otherworldly customers. Chihiro must work in the bathhouse to save her parents and find a way to return home. The story is a tale of resilience,as Chihiro gradually finds her inner strength.
The movie arrived at a time when people thought animation was for children. Spirited Away destroyed prejudice about the art form and proved that a movie created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore could reach global audiences of all ages.
Jane Napier, a film critic, underlines the global impact of the movie. The movie''s theme is uncertainty. "I think this is one reason why this movie is so popular, it recognizes that the world can be scary, and that we don''t always know what''s going to happen to us," Napier explains.
To Yoshioka, a Studio Ghibli fan, Spirited Away can be interpreted in numerous ways by the viewer. "This is key for the film to be loved as a classic," he says.

People in Hong Kong are famous for working long hours. However,it is now recognized that obsession with work can be an addiction. In Japan, it is called death by overwork and it is estimated to cause 1,000 deaths per year. In the USA, it is known as the ''respectable'' addiction.
Addiction to work is not the same as working hard or putting in long hours. Hard-working people generally have some balance in their lives. They spend a lot of time at work,but also set aside time for their hobbies, such as playing sport. However, work addicts think about work even when they are playing sport. The obsession with work is total. It prevents them from maintaining healthy relationships and outside interests. Work addicts neglect their health and ignore their friends and family. They avoid going on holiday so they don''t have to miss work,and even if they do go on holiday,they still think about work.
Often, work addicts only realize they have a problem when something terrible happens, for example,when their health completely fails or they start having family problems."}'::text[], '{"why Hong Kong people tend to work long hours","the health and social problems that can be caused by long working hours","things that people can do to avoid work addiction","anything else you think is important"}'::text[], '[{"text": "Do you have any friends or family members who work too hard?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What are some of the disadvantages of working on Saturday and Sunday?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think young people now work harder than their parents did in the past?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How do you think children are affected by parents who work long hours?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How can children in Hong Kong help parents who have to work long hours?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How much do you believe success depends on hard work?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How might a workplace be disadvantaged by having workaholics on its staff?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why do you think work addiction is known as the ''respectable addiction'' in the USA?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why do you think some people enjoy working so much?", "number": 9, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Some people live to work and others work to live.

  '["Can a personality test help decide your future career?\nThe Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a self-reported personality test that can help you find out what kind of person you are. Among other things,the test assesses people''s likes, dislikes, personal preferences, and possible career paths.\nThere are 16 personality types in total in the test. Many young people nowadays take the test to see if it can help them choose a suitable future job.\nAccording to LinkedIn, a website that helps people find suitable careers, job seekers can use the MBTI test in multiple ways. First, it can help them identify their strengths, weaknesses, preferred work style, and ability to get along with others. Additionally, people can find lists online showing how common each MBTI type is in various fields of work,which can help them choose a career that matches their personality.\n\"By using the MBTI, you can discover your personality type and how it influences your work preferences, behaviours, and outcomes,\" the site reports. \"You can also use the MBTI to find careers that match your type.\"\nHowever,it is not only potential employees who use the MBTI but employers as well. In China, many companies, including large international ones, now require job applicants to complete the test, and it is one of the factors that may help them decide whether to hire someone-or not.\n\"Some companies may not want to hire someone whose personality test results do not suit their goals,\" said Ning, a senior media executive."]'::jsonb,

For example, the groups aim to end poverty, reduce inequality and combat climate change.\nLearning key values\nFrom as young as six, boys and girls can join to learn about nature while playing games, making friends and learning important values. \"The key values of a Scout are respect for others, for oneself and for the environment\" says Morgan, a Belgian Scout leader. In Greece, for example, Scouts are given tips on how they can implement the SDGs in their daily lives, such as by asking for a donation to charity instead of a gift on their birthday to achieve Goal 1: No Poverty; or by not letting their tap run when brushing their teeth for Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.\nEveryone is welcome\nInclusion is an important principle of Scouting. \"Everyone is welcome in Scouting. One of the most important values for young people taking part is that everyone can participate and that you can be yourself,\" says Takahashi, Director of Scouting Japan. \"Cooking together at camp or sleeping in a tent promotes community life and respect for different opinions,\" says Luc, another Scout leader from Luxembourg.\nGlobal solidarity\nScouting not only brings young people together at a national level, but also internationally.

Its price and efficiency makes it popular, while lightweight bamboo is also easier to transport through a cramped urban centre.\n\"Bamboo scaffolds are suited to the odd and tight spaces in Hong Kong,\" adds instructor Kin Kee Wo, who has worked in the construction industry for nearly 30 years. \"It can be built in the most unthinkable places, in the most beautiful ways.\""]'::jsonb,

This time, it isn''t parents trying to prohibit their kids from becoming over-caffeinated: it''s Caligula Coffee, one of the largest coffee chains in the UK.\nAn employee''s recent refusal to serve an iced coffee to a 12-year-old is reigniting a controversial question. Should shops be allowed to ban the sale of coffee and energy drinks to teenagers and kids?\nWhile Caligula Coffee isn''t completely banning the sale of coffee to teenagers, the company''s new policy allows its employees to deny serving them drinks that contain caffeine, including energy drinks. \"We do not encourage the sale of caffeine to children under 16,\" the company''s spokesperson said. Some customers, including the 12-year-old''s father, are upset. He expressed his outrage online saying his daughter just deserved a treat.\nBut not everyone is against a ban. The UK government, for example, has been working to prohibit the sale of coffee and energy drinks to teenagers after declaring the link between caffeine consumption and various health issues among younger consumers too strong to ignore.\nThe National Institute of Health (NIH) says that significant amounts of caffeine affect the heart and blood vessels. According to Dr George of the NIH, when it comes to teenagers and caffeine, education and moderation are both key.And it''s also important to remember who you''re talking to. \"Beware once you tell someone, especially teenagers, that they can''t have something: they will find a way to get their hands on it.\""]'::jsonb,

After the gap year,he knew what his ideal working environment would look like in his future career. \"Whether the company vision aligns with my personal values is really important.\"\nBesides travelling and volunteering, young people from Asia also choose to intern and work to enrich their resumés and sharpen their competitive edge. However, Sascha Choi On, a student who has just started studying at CUHK has a different view: \"Nowadays it''s changing.

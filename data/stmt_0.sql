The Australian Federal Government recently decided to replace history and geography as compulsory subjects in secondary school and bring in computer programming classes instead. This will see students from as young as Primary 5 learning about how a computer works and how to write their own computer programs. Computer classes in school used to be about learning how to use Ms Word and Excel - now it''s looking at the world like an engineer - developing logical thinking and creativity.
The move makes sense given how much technology is in our lives and practically every job requires you to demonstrate some kind of computer skills. Equipping children with advanced computer skills early on in life could help them secure a bright future in a world which is becoming more high tech. This is something that other countries like the US and UK are already doing.
However, some people think that teaching children history and geography is equally important. Studying history teaches children to learn from the mistakes people made in the past, which will help them to develop sound decision-making and judgement skills. Likewise, studying geography helps us to understand the connectivity between people and places and to appreciate the Earth as the home that we all share. It can teach us how to better manage the planet''s resources and to become a better global citizen."}'::text[], '{"whether students should learn history and geography at school","whether computer programming should be taught at primary school","other subjects that can help students develop logical thinking and creativity","anything else you think is important"}'::text[], '[{"text": "Would you like to learn computer programming?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you like learning history and geography?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What would you rather study: arts or science?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What is the most important skill you learnt at school?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why do you think some students might not want to learn computer programming?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think all your subjects help you develop logical thinking and creativity?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think schools should help students get a job or develop life skills?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think there are other subjects that should be dropped from the Hong Kong curriculum?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

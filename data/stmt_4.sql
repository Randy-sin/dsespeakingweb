The Hong Kong Fire Services Department is seeking hundreds of recruits
As a member of the Hong Kong Fire Services Department (FSD), whose primary purpose it is to serve and protect the community, a Hong Kong firefighter has a challenging career. At the same time,being a firefighter offers a variety of career opportunities, is hugely rewarding and has an excellent starting salary ($18,000 per month).
The men and women of the FSD can be called upon to cover a range of incidents, including traffic and industrial accidents, gas leakages, landslides, flooding, building collapses, and even malfunctioning lifts
In the next year,the FSD is aiming to recruit 60 station officers and 160 firefighters.
\"The first and most important question that anyone considering a career as a Hong Kong firefighter should ask themselves is:''Do I have the wholehearted willingness to serve the community?'',\" says Wong Ka-wing, divisional officer of the FSD''s recruitment, training and examination group. \"Being a firefighter is about being trustworthy, and someone the public can always rely on in any situation.\"
Those wishing to be a firefighter have to complete a 36-week training programme. Then recruits are assigned to fire stations around Hong Kong to begin a three-year probation period. \"On-the-job field training is very important because this is where recruits are dealing with real-life scenarios,\" says Wong. The FSD also provides public education and awareness training and carries out fire safety inspections on licensed premises."}'::text[], '{"what skills and qualities are needed to be a good firefighter","the advantages and disadvantages of working as a firefighter","activities that you could organise to help students learn about the job","anything else you think is important"}'::text[], '[{"text": "Would you like to be a firefighter?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would your parents like you to become a firefighter?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What do you think is the worst part of being a firefighter?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think a high academic qualification is necessary to be a firefighter?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What do you think would be the best part of working for the Fire Services Department?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think the job of a firefighter is rewarding?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should duties be different for male and female firefighters?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Does Hong Kong society appreciate firefighters?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

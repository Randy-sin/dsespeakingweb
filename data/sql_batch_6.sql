  '["Hong Kong''s growing second-hand luxury clothes culture\nRedress, an NGO promoting sustainability through popularising second-hand fashion,is back with its seasonal \"Get Redressed #ShopSecondhand\" pop-up store in Hong Kong. Located at Taikoo Place, Quarry Bay, the second-hand pop-up store''s success over the years shows a growing second-hand culture in the city. Meanwhile, online second-hand luxury fashion platforms like Hula, Vestiaire Collective and Little Dot Vintage sell discounted items from brands like Dior, Chanel, and Gucci.\nShoppers can expect to see donated second-hand clothes and accessories from all over Hong Kong, with pieces ranging from luxury designer labels to more trendy and affordable ones, according to Redress'' event page. The clothing items up for resale are donated by people and collected through the NGO''s takeback program. With something for everyone, the event is expected to be size- and gender-inclusive, while shoppers will be confident that they are reducing their carbon footprint by buying second-hand clothes that would otherwise end up in the city''s landfills.\nAccording to Redress'' 2020 study on Hong Kong''s fashion consumption, changes in consumer habits were considerable after the pandemic,with two out of three actively changing their behaviour, and 30 per cent of respondents acknowledging the environmental cost of shopping habits. What is particularly interesting is that 31 per cent of respondents already own second-hand clothing, while 12 per cent have been reselling clothes online and offline as well There is no doubt about the sustainable fashion industry''s potential in Hong Kong."]'::jsonb,

  '["In trilingual Hong Kong, Korean language is the new kid on the block\nFor decades, French, Spanish, German and Japanese have been the most popular foreign languages among Hong Kong students. But in recent years, Korean has emerged as the new kid on the block. The latest estimate by the Korean consulate in Hong Kong showed that there were around 40,000 Korean learners in 2024 based on enrolment figures at universities and private academies.\nIn secondary schools, most Korean lessons are taught as extracurricular classes. But some have gone a step further to include the language in their curriculum as an elective. The introduction of Korean into the public school curriculum, although still at an early stage, is significant and a testament to its popularity, experts say. Professor Li Chor-Shing said the launching of Korean classes in public schools shows that many young people are motivated to learn Korean, and that it could help students with their future career prospects.\nTeachers say Korean has gained popularity in public schools as young people see learning Korean as more than just a hobby. Ms. Lai, who has taught Korean for over 10 years, said she has seen a shift in the past two to three years in the reasons young people want to learn the language. \"It used to be K-pop fans wanting to learn how to write ''Oppa, I love you'' in letters to their idols,\" Ms. Lai said. \"But now, aside from that, students also see Korea as a study destination or they want to work there.\""]'::jsonb,

  '["Urban beekeeping: A good idea?\nThousands have taken up urban beekeeping in Sydney. The reaction from neighbours is not always positive. Rob Simms has three beehives in his garden, and gives away jars of honey to keep his neighbours sweet. \"I delayed doing anything for six months because I thought I wouldn''t get neighbour approval,\" Simms said. \"Now I give people jars of honey and everyone''s happy.\"\nBut the beekeeping boom has created problems for urban living. Catherine Heath, a resident, considers herself pro-bee. However, this spring her garden has become a no-go zone because of aggressive bees, and she noticed an adjoining house had a sign on the front fence advertising homegrown honey. \"It''s to the point that in good weather, we can''t use the backyard most of the time\" Heath says. \"There are a lot of bees and they behave in a strange way. They attack both dogs and humans unprovoked.\"\nDouglas Purdie, president of Sydney Bee Club, said this was not unheard of. \"Bees, like all wild things, go through cycles and temperament, just like you can have a dog that''s very nice today and tomorrow bites you,\"he said.\nThe Department of Primary Industries says Sydney has over 15,000 registered beekeepers and around 400,000 hives. Dr Tobias Smith, a researcher at the University of Queensland, comments that native Australian bees are stingless. \"If you have flowers around, they will just do their own thing, and you sit back and enjoy watching them,\" Smith said. \"They''re a really easy pet.\""]'::jsonb,

  '["Young people love subtitles; older people, not so much\nAnyone who has ever watched movies or TV shows should be familiar with subtitles.\nThese are words that are shown on the bottom or side of a screen to indicate what the speakers on screen are saying. For viewers to follow along with the story,the timing of the texts must be the same as the timing of the people speaking.\nOriginally, subtitles had two main purposes: to translate the words from a foreign language into your own language, and to allow people who have hearing problems to understand the words being spoken.\nRecently, however, there has been a new trend among young people in the UK. According to research, 4 out of 5 viewers between the age of 18-25 use subtitles all the time - even when watching movies or TV shows in their own language - while less than 25% of people aged between 56-75 do so.\n\"I think it''s natural now for young people to accept subtitles,\" said UK media expert Melanie Sharpe. She added that while older people feel that using subtitles while listening to someone speak \"requires too much thinking,\" young people \"can take in far more information quickly because they''re used to it.\"\nNobody knows exactly how this trend started, but one theory is that young people grew up with seeing subtitles on social media and are now comfortable with them.\nAnother factor may be the poor sound quality of streamed videos. \"They might be using subtitles because of background noise or changing volumes,\" Sharpe said."]'::jsonb,

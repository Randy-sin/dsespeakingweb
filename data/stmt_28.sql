Teenagers now have another thing to worry about: coffee. This time, it isn''t parents trying to prohibit their kids from becoming over-caffeinated: it''s Caligula Coffee, one of the largest coffee chains in the UK.
An employee''s recent refusal to serve an iced coffee to a 12-year-old is reigniting a controversial question. Should shops be allowed to ban the sale of coffee and energy drinks to teenagers and kids?
While Caligula Coffee isn''t completely banning the sale of coffee to teenagers, the company''s new policy allows its employees to deny serving them drinks that contain caffeine, including energy drinks. \"We do not encourage the sale of caffeine to children under 16,\" the company''s spokesperson said. Some customers, including the 12-year-old''s father, are upset. He expressed his outrage online saying his daughter just deserved a treat.

According to Dr George of the NIH, when it comes to teenagers and caffeine, education and moderation are both key.And it''s also important to remember who you''re talking to. \"Beware once you tell someone, especially teenagers, that they can''t have something: they will find a way to get their hands on it.\""}'::text[], '{"negative effects of coffee and energy drinks on teenagers'' health","what the club can do to make those effects known among students","whether coffee and energy drinks should be sold to teenagers","anything else you think is important"}'::text[], '[{"text": "Do you like energy drinks?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What drinks are popular among teenagers?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do young people drink more coffee than old people?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you believe the coffee ban for teenagers is a good idea?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Should schools ban unhealthy drinks?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What advice could you give a parent whose child drinks too many energy drinks?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What can be done to help teenagers consume fewer energy drinks?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you agree that banning something is not likely to work with teenagers?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

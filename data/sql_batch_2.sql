  '["Body art expresses individuality\nMore and more teenagers are turning to different forms of body art, such as tattooing and nose piercing, to establish their personal identity and look different. One of the main reasons young people decide to modify their bodies is to look cool. Teenagers want to express their individuality and have a strong desire to stand out from the crowd. This gives them a sense of uniqueness that makes them different from everyone else.\n19-year-old James Keen is a typical example. He is one of the first in Hong Kong to have had the tip of his tongue split into two.''When I first saw it in some teen magazines,I thought tongue-splitting was the most beautiful thing I''d seen in my life,'' says James. Most of his friends do not know that he has had his tongue split unless he shows it to them.When asked how he felt about the splitting process, James said it did cause some pain for about a week, especially when he ate,but he believed it was worthwhile.''Piercing of the ears,nose and lips is just too common.I wanted something different.''"]'::jsonb,

In Japan, it is called death by overwork and it is estimated to cause 1,000 deaths per year. In the USA, it is known as the ''respectable'' addiction.\nAddiction to work is not the same as working hard or putting in long hours. Hard-working people generally have some balance in their lives. They spend a lot of time at work,but also set aside time for their hobbies, such as playing sport. However, work addicts think about work even when they are playing sport. The obsession with work is total. It prevents them from maintaining healthy relationships and outside interests. Work addicts neglect their health and ignore their friends and family. They avoid going on holiday so they don''t have to miss work,and even if they do go on holiday,they still think about work.\nOften, work addicts only realize they have a problem when something terrible happens, for example,when their health completely fails or they start having family problems."]'::jsonb,

Instead, vocational education and training (VET) is a very common pathway to gain skills and embark on a successful career. VET combines job-training and study, so students can both study and work at the same time. VET offers certifications for people who are interested in becoming an electrician, tax specialist, nurse, ambulance worker, dental technician, hairdresser, film and video editor, and product designer.\nDepending on the job, trainees may work for three to four days a week in the company, factory, or shop to learn practical skills through on-the-job training. Trainees earn a modest salary which helps with student expenses.\nOn the other days, students go to school to learn both job-specific and general education subjects, such as English, maths, and physical education. The program usually lasts between two and four years. At the end of the training, students take an examination and are then given their certifications. They can continue to work in the place they were trained, study to obtain further qualifications or even become self-employed.\nThe VET program supplies Germany''s companies with well-trained employees. It also helps trainees transition into work life. VET opens up a variety of promising career options for young people. Both young people and adults wanting to change careers can take part."]'::jsonb,

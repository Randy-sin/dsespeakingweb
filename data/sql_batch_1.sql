  '["Will everyone be eating insects by 2050?\nBy 2050 the population is expected to reach 9billion. To feed all of those hungry mouths, we will need to produce almost twice as much food as we currently do. But that isn''t going to be easy. One possible solution? Insects.\nEating insects is a common practice that''s been taking place for thousands of years. Around 2 billion people regularly eat insects as part of their diet, and over 1,900 species are edible. The most commonly eaten bugs are beetles, caterpillars, bees, wasps and ants.\nSo what''s so good about insects? Well, they''re nutritious and healthy. Insects actually have a high fat, protein, vitamin, fibre and mineral content that is often comparable to fish or livestock. Beetles, for example, contain on average 205 g/kg protein; beef contains 256 g/kg.\nRaising insects as a source of food as opposed to farmed animals is more environmentally friendly. Insects require significantly less land and water than traditionally-farmed animals and also reproduce much more quickly. Additionally, insects produce a fraction of the greenhouse gases when compared with other livestock, particularly cattle. Finally, insect farming can provide jobs and income to people living in poor areas. Insects are sustainable, green, nutritious and could help people out of poverty.

He said, ''I had a good business and a good life when one day I was pulled from my bed into an alien spacecraft'' At first he refused to co-operate with the aliens. But as the years passed, he got to understand more about them and even seemed to have won the trust of the aliens. ''They know us better as a person than we know ourselves. Not only can they read our minds, they also have the technology to be invisible,'' Sparks insists.\nWhile many of the audience listened quietly, some had clearly had enough. One of those who headed for the door said, ''He''s a pretty good storyteller because he seems so sincere, but for me it''s too much like science-fiction.''"]'::jsonb,

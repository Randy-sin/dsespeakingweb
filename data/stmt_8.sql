An American who claims that he was taken away by aliens left some members of his Hong Kong audience completely lost. 56-year-old market researcher Jim Sparks was invited to speak by the Hong Kong UFO (Unidentified Flying Objects) Club.
Sparks said aliens first abducted him in 1988 when he was a property developer. He said, ''I had a good business and a good life when one day I was pulled from my bed into an alien spacecraft'' At first he refused to co-operate with the aliens. But as the years passed, he got to understand more about them and even seemed to have won the trust of the aliens. ''They know us better as a person than we know ourselves. Not only can they read our minds, they also have the technology to be invisible,'' Sparks insists.
While many of the audience listened quietly, some had clearly had enough. One of those who headed for the door said, ''He''s a pretty good storyteller because he seems so sincere, but for me it''s too much like science-fiction.''"}'::text[], '{"whether there is life on other planets","whether you believe that aliens have visited Earth","whether aliens would be a threat or a benefit to our planet","anything else you think is important"}'::text[], '[{"text": "What do you think aliens would look like?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you enjoy watching movies about aliens?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you believe someone if they said they had met an alien?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What information about human beings do you think might be useful for aliens to learn?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is it worth spending money on trying to locate alien life in the universe?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "If there are no aliens,why do so many people claim to have met them?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "If there were aliens, what would they think about human life on earth?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What positive outcomes could result from learning about alien culture?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Thousands have taken up urban beekeeping in Sydney. The reaction from neighbours is not always positive. Rob Simms has three beehives in his garden, and gives away jars of honey to keep his neighbours sweet. "I delayed doing anything for six months because I thought I wouldn''t get neighbour approval," Simms said. "Now I give people jars of honey and everyone''s happy."
But the beekeeping boom has created problems for urban living. Catherine Heath, a resident, considers herself pro-bee. However, this spring her garden has become a no-go zone because of aggressive bees, and she noticed an adjoining house had a sign on the front fence advertising homegrown honey. "It''s to the point that in good weather, we can''t use the backyard most of the time" Heath says. "There are a lot of bees and they behave in a strange way. They attack both dogs and humans unprovoked."
Douglas Purdie, president of Sydney Bee Club, said this was not unheard of. "Bees, like all wild things, go through cycles and temperament, just like you can have a dog that''s very nice today and tomorrow bites you,"he said.
The Department of Primary Industries says Sydney has over 15,000 registered beekeepers and around 400,000 hives. Dr Tobias Smith, a researcher at the University of Queensland, comments that native Australian bees are stingless. "If you have flowers around, they will just do their own thing, and you sit back and enjoy watching them," Smith said. "They''re a really easy pet."'],ARRAY[E'benefits of beekeeping at school', E'problems that beekeeping could cause at school', E'other activities that could help students to learn about bees', E'anything else you think is important'],'[{"text": "Do you like honey?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Are you scared of bees?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you like to have an insect as a pet?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you like to keep bees?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How can schools make beekeeping safe for students?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would your neighbours be upset if you took up beekeeping?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think Hong Kong is suitable for urban beekeeping?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How else can schools promote a connection with nature?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb,'2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00','2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Anyone who has ever watched movies or TV shows should be familiar with subtitles.
These are words that are shown on the bottom or side of a screen to indicate what the speakers on screen are saying. For viewers to follow along with the story,the timing of the texts must be the same as the timing of the people speaking.
Originally, subtitles had two main purposes: to translate the words from a foreign language into your own language, and to allow people who have hearing problems to understand the words being spoken.
Recently, however, there has been a new trend among young people in the UK. According to research, 4 out of 5 viewers between the age of 18-25 use subtitles all the time - even when watching movies or TV shows in their own language - while less than 25% of people aged between 56-75 do so.
"I think it''s natural now for young people to accept subtitles," said UK media expert Melanie Sharpe. She added that while older people feel that using subtitles while listening to someone speak "requires too much thinking," young people "can take in far more information quickly because they''re used to it."
Nobody knows exactly how this trend started, but one theory is that young people grew up with seeing subtitles on social media and are now comfortable with them.
Another factor may be the poor sound quality of streamed videos. "They might be using subtitles because of background noise or changing volumes," Sharpe said.'],ARRAY[E'benefits of adding subtitles to the programmes', E'whether adding subtitles to programmes would be popular among students', E'type of programmes subtitles are not suitable for', E'anything else you think is important'],'[{"text": "Is there a Campus TV channel at your school?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you usually use subtitles when watching movies?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you prefer English or Chinese subtitles?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Are movies without subtitles difficult to watch?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Are movies with subtitles less enjoyable?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you agree that young people like subtitles?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you prefer to have subtitles when watching a movie in your own language?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Can subtitles help people to learn a language?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb,'2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00','2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

As artificial intelligence or ''AI'' becomes more widely used and starts replacing some traditional jobs, many young people worry about their future careers.
According to some experts, however, there is one popular job trend which will not be easily taken over by AI: being a ''personal shopper''.
A personal shopper refers to a person who helps customers find products that they need by doing their shopping for them. Instead of visiting real stores or spending hours searching online, a customer with little free time can find a personal shopper with the right skills, knowledge and connections to help meet their needs.
"This is a job that has grown quickly," says American business executive Tom Ward. "And it''s grown in line with the way that customers want to shop."
The best personal shoppers have expert knowledge of their field. To become a professional clothing shopper, for instance, you need to learn everything about fashion, from the top designer names to the latest fashion trends.
While AI assistants may also have such knowledge, the benefit of human shoppers is that when they visit stores to locate good quality or ''on sale'' items, they build personal relationships with store owners and supply shops. This can help a human shopper see the quality of the goods, get the best possible prices, and even find unusual products not available online. These benefits, say retail experts, mean that human personal shoppers are still the best choice.'],ARRAY[E'whether being a personal shopper would be a good job for teenagers', E'if AI will one day replace human salespeople in face-to-face shopping', E'how shopping will change in the future', E'anything else you think is important'],'[{"text": "Do you like shopping?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Where is your favourite place to shop?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you prefer to shop alone or with friends?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you prefer shopping online or in a shop?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you be a good personal clothes shopper?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What do you think would be difficult about being a personal shopper?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you hire a personal shopper if you were too busy to shop yourself?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is shopping a leisure activity or a necessity?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb,'2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00','2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Carrying three lenses, two cameras and a tripod with him,Mainland Chinese tourist, Wei Qingyu, arrived at a basketball court with his girlfriend in search of a photo spot in Kennedy Town on a cloudy day. But why this sports facility in a residential area on Hong Kong Island?
Wei said it provided the perfect vantage point to capture the city''s historic trams going along a vibrant street against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour. It was a tip Wei saw on Xiaohongshu, an Instagram-like social media platform popular on the Mainland and beyond.
Xiaohongshu, known for travel tips, has more than 200 million active users, with more than 70 per cent of the users born in the 1990s. The app has reshaped Hong Kong''s tourism landscape, as influencers share ideas and tips for previously ordinary places. Some bring takeaways from McDonald''s to MacDonnell Road in Mid-Levels for a fun photo. Others flock to Yau Ma Tei Police Station for a shot of the iconic building.
Another destination popularised on Xiaohongshu is a busy footbridge in Mong Kok. Colourful neon signs adorning the residential buildings are a popular draw for tourists, who want to capture the nostalgic vintage vibe of Hong Kong.
"The scenery, with some background music, seems quite romantic," a Malaysian tourist said.

In 1985,a little Italian plumber became the face of video games, and changed the way we play them.''Super Mario Bros'' featured the main character in the game, Mario, jumping around collecting coins and rushing to save Princess Peach from a villainous turtle.
At the time, video games were usually created by computer engineers, as opposed to today''s artists.
"I was trying to use the technology available at the time to produce a distinctive-looking character from a small number of pixels, and that resulted in Mario," said Shigeru Miyamoto, the game designer and producer of Super Mario Bros. As to why he picked a 26-year-old Italian-American plumber from New York as the main character, Miyamoto said, "We wanted him to be someone who might live near you, and not a superhero."
"People had never seen a game like Super Mario Bros," said Frank Cifaldi, co-director of the Video Game History Foundation, "Super Mario Bros manages to convey an epic adventure in a massive world. Day turns to night as you progress. You cross bridges into new lands." Super Mario Bros changed the way we play video games - "from merely aiming for a high score to playing a game to experience an adventure and see it through to its ending,"he said.
To celebrate Super Mario''s 40th anniversary, Nintendo has launched Mario-centred games.

If you were trying to guess which social media sites are becoming popular among teenagers, what would you choose? Snapchat? Instagram? Facebook?
You might be surprised to learn that a growing number of high schoolers are now turning to a site that is all about success at work: LinkedIn.
The world''s largest online professional network, LinkedIn, helps people find the right jobs, connect with others in their field, make important professional connections and learn skills necessary for career success. It also allows users to join career-related discussions and to read, and comment on, articles from their field.
According to recent studies, many teenagers in North America now see LinkedIn as the hottest social media platform. This is partly because they are trying to prepare themselves for today''s fast-moving job market, but also because they like the positive tone of the site.
"When I go on Facebook,I just see people with horrible feelings and bad ideas," said one teenager. "And when I go on LinkedIn, it''s so positive and honest--this is how social media should be."
Many secondary students also say that they like LinkedIn because it helps them to find role models, to follow their interests, and to learn about possible future job trends.

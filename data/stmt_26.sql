Many Scout organizations worldwide have committed to achieving the United Nation''s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, the groups aim to end poverty, reduce inequality and combat climate change.
Learning key values
From as young as six, boys and girls can join to learn about nature while playing games, making friends and learning important values. \"The key values of a Scout are respect for others, for oneself and for the environment\" says Morgan, a Belgian Scout leader. In Greece, for example, Scouts are given tips on how they can implement the SDGs in their daily lives, such as by asking for a donation to charity instead of a gift on their birthday to achieve Goal 1: No Poverty; or by not letting their tap run when brushing their teeth for Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.
Everyone is welcome
Inclusion is an important principle of Scouting. \"Everyone is welcome in Scouting. One of the most important values for young people taking part is that everyone can participate and that you can be yourself,\" says Takahashi, Director of Scouting Japan. \"Cooking together at camp or sleeping in a tent promotes community life and respect for different opinions,\" says Luc, another Scout leader from Luxembourg.
Global solidarity
Scouting not only brings young people together at a national level, but also internationally. Thousands of young members from 171 countries meet every four years at the World Scout Jamboree. Held in a different location each time, the 10-day educational event promotes peace and friendship."}'::text[], '{"benefits of Scouting for secondary school students","activities to organise for the club","ways to encourage other students to join the club","anything else you think is important"}'::text[], '[{"text": "Do you enjoy nature?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you like to be a Scout?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you ever gone camping?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you enjoy sleeping in a tent?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Is camping a popular activity in Hong Kong?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you prefer camping in a Scout group or with your family?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you agree Scouts could make the world a better place?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What lessons that you learn as a Scout would be the most important?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

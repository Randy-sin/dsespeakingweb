  '["How phobias happen, and what you can do if you have an irrational fear\nHave you heard of Chelonaphobia, or fear of turtles? Emily Ko, a Hong Kong-born freelance writer is scared of turtles, and while it sounds silly to most people, that''s exactly what a phobia is - an extreme fear of a threat and expecting danger that''s out of proportion to the actual risk.\n\"I was five years old when my parents came home with two pet turtles,\" Emily says. \"I freaked out. Obviously, my parents didn''t throw away the turtles - they put them in my brother''s room. But these things live long lives...I didn''t go into that bedroom for 10 years.\"\nHong Kong-based hypnotherapist Sonia Samtani has dealt with a range of phobias - some common, some not. \"I''ve treated people for fear of public speaking, cockroaches, needles, medical procedures, flying and dark spaces, and less common phobias such as cats, escalators, and pigeons.\" Samtani says phobias can also eat away at a person''s self-confidence and self-esteem. The impact may get more severe if that person doesn''t know why they are scared of something.\nHowever, there are techniques that can help people overcome even the most extreme phobias. One popular type of treatment that helps people change the way they think and behave, is to gradually expose them to their fear so they feel less anxious about it. In this way, people don''t have to suffer from phobias all their lives."]'::jsonb,

The company defended its tours and said it was committed to helping \"build a responsible tourism community and improve the lives of animals in the travel industry.\"\n\"Our approach is to continually work with operators to encourage long-term and sustainable change, which not only takes into consideration animal welfare but also communities who are directly impacted by the industry,\" a company spokesperson said. \"We continue to work with our partners across the world to achieve this. One example is elephant tourism in Thailand, which comes with a cultural and religious heritage, and is beneficial for the local communities and the economy,\"she added.\nEarlier this year, the travel company vowed to end ticketing for some animal attractions. Under its new policy, situations where wild animals are drugged or abused are banned. This ban extends to circuses and shows during which animals are forced to perform unnatural behaviour.\nHowever, the animal welfare NGO, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, shared a video that showed dead bodies of horses and camels outside a tourist site in Egypt. While camel-riding activities in Egypt are listed as \"currently unavailable\" on Vapido''s website, the company continues to offer camel rides in places including Dubai, Morocco, and Turkey."]'::jsonb,

  '["Music groups no longer dominate the pop charts\nWhen the British rock group The Beatles first visited America in 1964, it set off a musical explosion. Not only did this group become hugely popular around the world, but young people everywhere also started buying musical instruments and forming pop and rock groups of their own.\nFor the rest of the 20th century, music groups dominated the pop charts. In the year 2000, for instance, over 80% of the songs listed in the ''Hot 100'' biggest musical acts compiled by Billboard magazine were by pop,rock or hip-hop groups.\nHow times have changed. According to recent data, very few of the hottest songs from the year 2024 were from music groups. In August 2024, only one group, Imagine Dragons, had a hit in the Global Top 50. Individual performers like Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Eminem and Dua Lipa now dominate the charts.\nWhile there are many reasons for this trend,experts say that the biggest factor has been the rise of social media. As music executive Chris Price notes, social media \"is mainly a solo activity. It''s easier as an individual singer to express what kind of artist you are on YouTube or Instagram than for four people to do the same thing.\"\nAnother factor is the improved technology for recording music alone, as software like Ableton Live allows people to make high-quality music at home. \"In the past, if you wanted to make music for people to dance to, you needed a band,\"says Price. \"Now you just need a laptop.\""]'::jsonb,

  '["The art of self-care\nMore often than not, we are busy with work, maintaining our friendships and checking in with our families. And as we enjoy taking care of others, it''s also important to take care of ourselves. Self-care is key to our physical and mental health.\n\"Self-care is when you engage in activities that take care of yourself,\" Valerie Ho, the founder of an e-commerce platform specializing in self-care products, explains. When we do not engage in self-care activities, \"physically, we feel the symptoms of stress, things like increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, headaches, and stomach upsets. From a mental health perspective, there is an increase in anxiety or depression, and emotionally, people may find themselves more easily irritated or crying without any reason,\" says Odile Thiang from MindHK, an NGO focusing on wellbeing among Hong Kong people.\nAccording to Odile, there are three pillars of self-care - exercise, sleep, and diet. Regular exercise is not only important for your physical health, but from a mental health perspective, it has been shown to treat feelings of anxiety and depression. Getting enough sleep is also an incredibly important part of self-care and helps us recharge. And watching what you eat is beneficial to both your body and your emotions.\nIf you don''t know where to start, Odile suggests trying coupling - pairing something you love with something you know is good for you, but you''re not too keen on. \"A lot of people find it hard to get motivated about exercising, so couple it with watching your favourite Netflix show.\""]'::jsonb,

Directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli, Spirited Away would leave a mark on animation in the 21st century.\nThe story follows an ordinary 10-year-old girl, Chihiro, as she arrives at a deserted theme park that turns into a world of spirits at night. Her parents are turned into pigs by Yubaba, the witch who manages a bathhouse serving otherworldly customers. Chihiro must work in the bathhouse to save her parents and find a way to return home. The story is a tale of resilience,as Chihiro gradually finds her inner strength.\nThe movie arrived at a time when people thought animation was for children. Spirited Away destroyed prejudice about the art form and proved that a movie created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore could reach global audiences of all ages.\nJane Napier, a film critic, underlines the global impact of the movie. The movie''s theme is uncertainty. \"I think this is one reason why this movie is so popular, it recognizes that the world can be scary, and that we don''t always know what''s going to happen to us,\" Napier explains.\nTo Yoshioka, a Studio Ghibli fan, Spirited Away can be interpreted in numerous ways by the viewer. \"This is key for the film to be loved as a classic,\" he says. \"So, even 20 years on, Spirited Away is a movie that can be watched and rewatched.\""]'::jsonb,

If you were trying to guess which social media sites are becoming popular among teenagers, what would you choose? Snapchat? Instagram? Facebook?
You might be surprised to learn that a growing number of high schoolers are now turning to a site that is all about success at work: LinkedIn.
The world''s largest online professional network, LinkedIn, helps people find the right jobs, connect with others in their field, make important professional connections and learn skills necessary for career success. It also allows users to join career-related discussions and to read, and comment on, articles from their field.
According to recent studies, many teenagers in North America now see LinkedIn as the hottest social media platform. This is partly because they are trying to prepare themselves for today''s fast-moving job market, but also because they like the positive tone of the site.
\"When I go on Facebook,I just see people with horrible feelings and bad ideas,\" said one teenager. \"And when I go on LinkedIn, it''s so positive and honest--this is how social media should be.\"
Many secondary students also say that they like LinkedIn because it helps them to find role models, to follow their interests, and to learn about possible future job trends.

  '["An unusual career that may be one of the most desired jobs of the future\nAs artificial intelligence or ''AI'' becomes more widely used and starts replacing some traditional jobs, many young people worry about their future careers.\nAccording to some experts, however, there is one popular job trend which will not be easily taken over by AI: being a ''personal shopper''.\nA personal shopper refers to a person who helps customers find products that they need by doing their shopping for them. Instead of visiting real stores or spending hours searching online, a customer with little free time can find a personal shopper with the right skills, knowledge and connections to help meet their needs.\n\"This is a job that has grown quickly,\" says American business executive Tom Ward. \"And it''s grown in line with the way that customers want to shop.\"\nThe best personal shoppers have expert knowledge of their field. To become a professional clothing shopper, for instance, you need to learn everything about fashion, from the top designer names to the latest fashion trends.\nWhile AI assistants may also have such knowledge, the benefit of human shoppers is that when they visit stores to locate good quality or ''on sale'' items, they build personal relationships with store owners and supply shops. This can help a human shopper see the quality of the goods, get the best possible prices, and even find unusual products not available online. These benefits, say retail experts, mean that human personal shoppers are still the best choice."]'::jsonb,

But why this sports facility in a residential area on Hong Kong Island?\nWei said it provided the perfect vantage point to capture the city''s historic trams going along a vibrant street against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour. It was a tip Wei saw on Xiaohongshu, an Instagram-like social media platform popular on the Mainland and beyond.\nXiaohongshu, known for travel tips, has more than 200 million active users, with more than 70 per cent of the users born in the 1990s. The app has reshaped Hong Kong''s tourism landscape, as influencers share ideas and tips for previously ordinary places. Some bring takeaways from McDonald''s to MacDonnell Road in Mid-Levels for a fun photo. Others flock to Yau Ma Tei Police Station for a shot of the iconic building.\nAnother destination popularised on Xiaohongshu is a busy footbridge in Mong Kok. Colourful neon signs adorning the residential buildings are a popular draw for tourists, who want to capture the nostalgic vintage vibe of Hong Kong.\n\"The scenery, with some background music, seems quite romantic,\" a Malaysian tourist said. \"Hong Kong feels familiar because its dramas and films are very popular in Malaysia, and we go hunting for places we see on the app.\""]'::jsonb,

As to why he picked a 26-year-old Italian-American plumber from New York as the main character, Miyamoto said, \"We wanted him to be someone who might live near you, and not a superhero.\"\n\"People had never seen a game like Super Mario Bros,\" said Frank Cifaldi, co-director of the Video Game History Foundation, \"Super Mario Bros manages to convey an epic adventure in a massive world. Day turns to night as you progress. You cross bridges into new lands.\" Super Mario Bros changed the way we play video games - \"from merely aiming for a high score to playing a game to experience an adventure and see it through to its ending,\"he said.\nTo celebrate Super Mario''s 40th anniversary, Nintendo has launched Mario-centred games.

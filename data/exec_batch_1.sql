Members of the media often complain that the government limits their freedom of expression, though many members of the public feel there is nothing wrong with this. Some years ago, photographs of Twins singer Gillian Chung Yan-tung were published by a local magazine, Easy Finder, and they caused a real storm. The photographs were taken with a hidden camera as she was changing costumes backstage. Many people were upset by this and demanded that press freedom be restricted. The Hong Kong Performing Artists Guild condemned the incident, and insisted the government amend the law and punish the magazine''s owners.
''Some people thought that the whole episode had been exaggerated, but people buy these magazines for exactly this kind of shocking content so it''s the market itself that demands such pictures,'' explained retired editor John Peters.

More and more teenagers are turning to different forms of body art, such as tattooing and nose piercing, to establish their personal identity and look different. One of the main reasons young people decide to modify their bodies is to look cool. Teenagers want to express their individuality and have a strong desire to stand out from the crowd. This gives them a sense of uniqueness that makes them different from everyone else.
19-year-old James Keen is a typical example. He is one of the first in Hong Kong to have had the tip of his tongue split into two.''When I first saw it in some teen magazines,I thought tongue-splitting was the most beautiful thing I''d seen in my life,'' says James. Most of his friends do not know that he has had his tongue split unless he shows it to them.When asked how he felt about the splitting process, James said it did cause some pain for about a week, especially when he ate,but he believed it was worthwhile.''Piercing of the ears,nose and lips is just too common.I wanted something different.'''],ARRAY[E'why some teenagers like body art such as tattooing and nose piercing', E'the medical dangers of body art', E'how Hong Kong society views people with tattoos and their bodies pierced', E'anything else you think is important'],'[{"text": "What do you think of teenagers who have tattoos and body piercing?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why do teenagers think body art is ''cool?''", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do any of your friends have tattoos and body piercing?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Have you ever thought about having a tattoo or body piercing?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why is it important for teenagers to express their individuality?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How do adults and parents feel about teenagers who have body modifications?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do teenagers go too far with body modifications these days?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What do you think are the long term problems of having a tattoo?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What other ways do young people try to ''stand out'' from the crowd?", "number": 9, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What advice would you give to a friend who wanted a tattoo or some kind of body-piercing?", "number": 10, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb,'2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00','2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

People in Hong Kong are famous for working long hours. However,it is now recognized that obsession with work can be an addiction. In Japan, it is called death by overwork and it is estimated to cause 1,000 deaths per year. In the USA, it is known as the ''respectable'' addiction.
Addiction to work is not the same as working hard or putting in long hours. Hard-working people generally have some balance in their lives. They spend a lot of time at work,but also set aside time for their hobbies, such as playing sport. However, work addicts think about work even when they are playing sport. The obsession with work is total. It prevents them from maintaining healthy relationships and outside interests. Work addicts neglect their health and ignore their friends and family. They avoid going on holiday so they don''t have to miss work,and even if they do go on holiday,they still think about work.
Often, work addicts only realize they have a problem when something terrible happens, for example,when their health completely fails or they start having family problems.'],ARRAY[E'why Hong Kong people tend to work long hours', E'the health and social problems that can be caused by long working hours', E'things that people can do to avoid work addiction', E'anything else you think is important'],'[{"text": "Do you have any friends or family members who work too hard?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What are some of the disadvantages of working on Saturday and Sunday?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think young people now work harder than their parents did in the past?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How do you think children are affected by parents who work long hours?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How can children in Hong Kong help parents who have to work long hours?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How much do you believe success depends on hard work?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How might a workplace be disadvantaged by having workaholics on its staff?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why do you think work addiction is known as the ''respectable addiction'' in the USA?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why do you think some people enjoy working so much?", "number": 9, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Some people live to work and others work to live.

Did you know most German students don''t want to go to university? Instead, vocational education and training (VET) is a very common pathway to gain skills and embark on a successful career. VET combines job-training and study, so students can both study and work at the same time. VET offers certifications for people who are interested in becoming an electrician, tax specialist, nurse, ambulance worker, dental technician, hairdresser, film and video editor, and product designer.
Depending on the job, trainees may work for three to four days a week in the company, factory, or shop to learn practical skills through on-the-job training. Trainees earn a modest salary which helps with student expenses.
On the other days, students go to school to learn both job-specific and general education subjects, such as English, maths, and physical education. The program usually lasts between two and four years. At the end of the training, students take an examination and are then given their certifications. They can continue to work in the place they were trained, study to obtain further qualifications or even become self-employed.
The VET program supplies Germany''s companies with well-trained employees. It also helps trainees transition into work life. VET opens up a variety of promising career options for young people.

Money
Hong Kong is a financial centre in Asia. It is no surprise that the smell of money, both banknotes and coins, is a symbolic smell of the city.
Seafood
One never forgets the strong smell of dried seafood in Sheung Wan and the smell of shrimp paste in Sai Kung. All over Hong Kong, in wet markets, the odour of fish stalls is another reminder of how close Hong Kong is to the sea.
Joss sticks and incense
In Chinese temples, burning joss sticks and incense gives off a relaxing and woody fragrance that reflects the cultural roots of Hong Kong.
Street food
Hong Kong people love street food, particularly food that has strong flavours and smells: curry fish balls, stinky tofu, egg tarts and fried chestnuts.
Exhaust fumes on the road
Unpleasant as it may be, the smell of the exhaust gases from cars, lorries and buses all year round just reflects the busy traffic and the energy of the city.
Greenery
Contrary to most people''s first impression, 75 percent of Hong Kong''s territory is actually green: country parks, agricultural or semi-rural land.

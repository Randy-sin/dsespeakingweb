However, regulations introduced by the Chinese government appear to have exerted a major influence on the mooncake market. \"Mooncakes have less wrapping compared to last year and more are in recyclable paper boxes rather than metal ones,\" said a Walmart salesperson in Beijing.\nWhile luxury boxes may not be as prominent this year, there is not much change to the Mid-Autumn \"gift culture\" at the core of the excess. \"It has become a custom we tiredly follow,\" said one customer, referring to the practice of sending expensive mooncakes to superiors and important friends. Until the Chinese start to question the time-honoured but outdated gift-sending mentality and encourage better packaging and recycling standards, Mid-Autumn Festival will continue to be a time of wasteful over-consumption."

However, some of the experienced cosplayers think that the standard of new cosplayers (who have less experience) is unacceptable, and feel that they are ruining the image of Hong Kong cosplayers in general. This is because they think that the newcomers' cosplay appearance does not accurately resemble the manga character, and they may not fully understand the character that they are impersonating.\nAccording to one blogger, this creates conflict among new and experienced cosplayers, threatening the harmonious environment of cosplay in Hong Kong."

As an actor, director, producer and scriptwriter, Chow has consistently produced films that have turned into box office gold.\nChow's entry into comedy began with the 1990 film *All For The Winner*. Received well by Asian audiences, Chow began to develop his distinct brand of humour known as 'Mo Lei Tau' and by 1994, found himself capable of writing and directing successful films of his own, such as *From Beijing with Love*, *God of Cookery* and *King of Comedy*.\nAttempting to cater to a wider audience outside Asia, Chow began to change the comedic style of his films, producing big budget productions which employed more comedic action, special effects and computer generated imagery, as seen in his 2001 hit *Shaolin Soccer*. His follow-up film *Kung Fu Hustle* finally brought him international acclaim, winning a BAFTA for 'Best Film Not in the English Language' and 'Best Director' at the Golden Horse Film Awards."

The number of participants is limited to 1,000, and in order to qualify as a participant, interested applicants need to show that they can swim 1,500 metres in 45 minutes.\nOne concern is whether the quality of water is suitable for swimmers, and another is whether the currents may be too strong. However, it seems that the swifter currents at Lei Yue Mun firstly help to keep the water cleaner than other parts of the harbour, and secondly help the swimmer to go with the flow to make the race easier. The event will not be harmful to swimmers, according to the organizers, the Hong Kong Amateur Swimming Association, and they hope to make the cross-harbour race an annual event."

With a population of 7 million squeezed into a small area, buildings have had to be built much higher to accommodate the expanding number of people who live and work in the city. While the height of buildings has risen, the size of the flats inside has got smaller. It is not uncommon for several family members to be sharing a small two-bedroom apartment. What effect does this lack of space have on people?\nIncreased mental problems is one issue associated with cramped living. Another is antisocial behaviour, especially when people are living in subdivided flats, where they often live in only one room with facilities that they must share with strangers. Indeed, problems are not just restricted to dealing with non-family members; a lack of space can also make it much more difficult to have harmonious relationships with those who are closest to us."

The landmark Wan Chai Market is becoming the base of a giant residential block, which will see its heritage and architecture destroyed. And now a developer has put in a demolition plan for what is probably the oldest house on the Peak, a handsome villa constructed in 1887.\nThe government, for its part, has destroyed by reclamation a huge area of the harbour at Central, and now proposes to sell the west wing of the Central Government Offices for redevelopment. The offices are part of Government Hill, Hong Kong's last true heritage zone, which its own consultant recommended be part of a new protected area. The government's intention to sell this important part of Government Hill, presumably to one of the developers that have already destroyed so much of the city's heritage and environment, will critically destroy the beauty of this heritage area."

Since 1997, 135 white dolphins have died. Nobody really knows what will happen to the remaining 200 dolphins in Hong Kong waters, if the planned development goes ahead. This is mainly due to the fact that the remains of the dead dolphins are generally in such poor condition that it has been impossible to work out what caused their death. Possible reasons are collisions with sea traffic, pollution and disease.\nReclamation would increase the size of the airport by another 50 percent and would be in an area inhabited by the dolphins. Along with other infrastructure projects, such as the construction of the bridge linking Hong Kong to Macau, many people believe the dolphins' survival can only happen if major conservation measures are adopted."

Yet nearly all parents think it is important for kids to learn responsible money management skills, and would like tools to help them teach these skills.\nA new cartoon show - *Cha-Ching Money Smart Kids* - features a band called Cha-Ching whose aim is to teach children the basic concepts about money in a fun and engaging way. The programme stresses four basic money management concepts - earn, save, spend and donate - so children learn the many ways they can use their pocket money. Most importantly, they are taught the differences between wants and needs.\n\"Changing behaviour takes practice and Cha-Ching gives kids the chance to practise the four money management concepts. Ultimately, this practice will help build essential and responsible money management habits,\" says the show's creator."

After finally trying their food though, we felt like we hadn't been missing out on much. The place itself is quite pleasant, with colourful and welcoming Spanish decoration. We sat down and ordered a couple of items from their menu for dinner.\nThe prawns with garlic and chili came nicely cooked, tender and juicy. The Iberico ham, though a small portion (15 grams) and a bit too soft, was only passable. Their mushroom and spinach dish was too creamy. Our main course was their signature paella (rice). We weren't expecting too much given its price ($128 for two people), but were still disappointed at the limited ingredients (a count-on-your-fingers amount of clams, prawns and chopped sausage) and the dry rice!\nAlong with its poor service, almost everything at El Torico screamed \"below average\". We're not very keen on going there for food again.\n**Verdict: 2 out of 5 stars**"

For example, in *Fear Factor*, a prime-time reality game show, contestants had to swallow live cockroaches in order to stay in a competition to win 1 million dollars.\nProponents of reality TV maintain that it engages with hot topics such as class and race, and captures the human spirit in a way that sitcoms and dramas cannot do.

Initiated by a group of European teachers in the 1950s, this model of home swapping travel can be generally described as 'I stay at your place - you stay at mine.' A variation is that the two parties alternately host each other, saving each other the expense of accommodation and providing a more \"local-flavoured\" trip.\nHome swapping deals are usually made online, through home swapping agencies such as Homeexchange.com, where registered members have their personal profiles, pictures of their houses and preferred destinations posted online. They are then able to match with others looking for exchanges.\n\"It is true that in Asian culture, we don't fancy inviting strangers to our homes nor do we feel comfortable at other people's places. People are more concerned about the potential risks rather than the benefits when talking about home swapping,\" said Steve Xue, Asian President of Homeexchange.com. He compares it to online dating which was initially rejected by mainstream society due to the potential risks, but he believes that business will boom once the positive aspects of home swapping are better understood by the public."

It features all types of playthings, from rare Qing dynasty figurines to the Cabbage Patch dolls and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles produced during the industry's 1980s heyday and the latest digital toys that hook up to iPods and iPhones.\nBut with kids turning to non-traditional playthings such as video games, computers, music and cosmetics at younger ages, some say toy manufacturing may be a sunset industry. That is something that Mr Yeung can't bring himself to agree with. \"As long as there are kids, they will need toys to play with.\""

I've been told by my employer that I can rewrite my own job description to make it even better, although it wouldn't mean much more money. Instead, I could go for a standard position with a bank, working much longer hours but with a starting salary at least 50 per cent more than I'm getting now. So my problem boils down to this: I'm twenty-seven this year; do I take the money or the job satisfaction?\n*Designer, male, 26*\n**\"I never wanted to be a lawyer, but now I'm stuck.\"**\nI did not grow up wanting to be a lawyer, I just ended up there because I had good grades and was attracted to the big salary. I travelled around the world for two years, but then had to come back to law-related work to pay the bills and mortgage. Now I'm in my late twenties and desperately want to do something meaningful. But I have obligations, and have acquired a certain lifestyle. So I lack the courage to change completely, to give up the big salary, even though I know I could be much happier doing something else.\n*Lawyer, female, almost 30*"

In the UK and US, they are million dollar businesses generating enormous revenue. But in Hong Kong, they are still not a part of the culture.\nTwo outdoor music festivals were discontinued in 2006 and 2010 because venue spaces were too small, nearby residents complained about the noise and the government was unsupportive. Similar difficulties confront the annual Clockenflap Music and Arts Festival which was held at the West Kowloon Cultural District. In their second year of running the festival, residents living near the venue complained they could not hear their television while the festival organizers were testing their sound equipment.\n\"The government needs to set aside the space and say, right, this is going to be used for outdoor events throughout the year, and if you build any residential space nearby, sorry, but there is going to be noise,\" says Mike Hill, Clockenflap's Festival Director. \"Hong Kong needs to have an open space allocated for music.

Dr Tan, a plastic surgeon, said he has seen a 25 percent increase in male patients each year who want to improve their looks.\nThese men come from all age groups and professions. Older men, in their 40s and upwards, usually seek treatment for age-related concerns such as hair loss, a big tummy and wrinkle lines. The younger ones in their 20s and 30s are interested in enhancing their looks, such as their nose, eyes, lips and skin.\nDr Tan believes that more men now see plastic surgery as a lifestyle choice. \"Instead of spending money on the latest computer, they would rather spend to 'upgrade' their looks to get an added advantage at work, especially for men who have to meet clients,\" he said. Additionally, advances in technology also mean that the procedures are safer, the results are better, and the recovery time is quicker."

But the situation is changing. A study started by the Hong Kong Institute of Education has found evidence of language learning and teaching on the social networking website YouTube.\nThe study investigated a video featuring the 2008 Olympics song, *Beijing Welcomes You*, which was sung in Mandarin Chinese. It was translated and subtitled by amateurs or fans into English - a process known as \"fansubbing\". The researchers were particularly interested in the comments made by viewers. They were investigating whether there was informal language teaching and learning taking place.\n\"We have seen language teaching and learning-related episodes where there is direct attention to language forms, but also episodes where there is relatively deep discussion of issues concerning languages and cultures,\" said principal investigator Professor Philip Benson.\nThe online interactions often involved English and Chinese speakers helping each other to learn each other's language. Findings showed that online language teaching and learning had \"an informal and playful character often characterised by a direct style of correction and expressing opinion that may be unique to YouTube.\""

They discovered many common factors:\n1. 80% are women;\n2. 60% live with their spouses or children, emphasising the importance of family care and support;\n3. 84% are non-smokers and 68% are non-drinkers;\n4. Fresh fruits and vegetables are the most common parts of their daily diet, while fatty and preserved food is avoided;\n5. 90% have three meals at regular times every day;\n6. 63% sleep at least eight hours every day;\n7. Doing housework and going on walks are their main sources of physical exercise; and\n8. 55% hold a positive attitude and do not view themselves as being a burden to their families.\nBased on the survey results, Yang summarised that having a long life requires observing four rules, namely, a proper diet, regular habits, exercise and a positive mindset."

It may have been frowned upon for decades but eating with your hands in a restaurant is now acceptable (e.g. for pizza), so long as you do not lick your fingers clean afterwards! In our more informal times, a new ten-point guide to acceptable modern dining behaviour and manners has been released.\nTop tips include cutting food into manageable pieces before picking it up, using a napkin to wipe messy hands and using a fork to pick up any food that spills onto the plate. It even reassures people that it is acceptable to use cutlery like knives and forks, even if fellow diners choose not to. Many traditional rules remain, such as sitting up straight, keeping elbows off the table, and waiting for food to cool instead of blowing on it. \"Table manners are no longer about sticking to a strict and outdated code of conduct. They exist for guidance but shouldn't take away from the pleasure of sharing a meal,\" experts say.\nBelow are four new rules:\n1. Never use your mobile phone at the table. Definitely no texting!\n2. Never wipe your mouth with your hand or talk with your mouth full.\n3. If eating with hands, take small bites so you don't spill anything.\n4. If you are using a napkin, place it on your lap.

Tough, in the book, supports this theory with stories of how 13-year-olds from low-income families can become chess masters through putting in hours and hours of practice. It is similar to the idea that Malcolm Gladwell raised in his book, *Outliers*: He says we need 10,000 hours of \"deliberate practice\" to master a skill.\nIn the book, Tough cites several studies that prove external incentives (rewards given by someone other than yourself) don't work in the long term. If you offer money for blood donations, over time fewer donors show up. If you offer cell-phone credits to students, their grades do not increase. Tough asserts that the motivation must come from within ourselves. Children need to want to succeed, to do well on the test, to understand what achieving something will bring them.\nWhile nowadays it may seem too cold and discouraging to have no sticker charts, house points or gold stars in school, it may be that we need to push our children to find their own internal incentives."

Almost 70% of students between the ages of 16 and 19 participate in a dual-enrollment track which allows them to study one to two days per week in a vocational education and training (VET) programme and spend the rest of their time in a paid on-the-job training programme that lasts three to four years.\nOne of the main benefits of the Swiss apprenticeship system is that students of all socio-economic and ability levels are engaged in this form of learning. The popularity of the apprenticeship system is proof that these programmes are not just for people who can't get into university.\nMoreover, because students entering dual-track VET programmes are often high performers, they are no less academic than students who chose university education rather than vocational training or dual education. As a result, Swiss dual-track VET students are likely to enter the workplace well prepared for work and having strong academic skills."

In 2009, the British government created a 3 million (HK$37.6 million) fund, providing companies and charities with grants to convert unused shops into spaces for community services.\nOne popular scheme saw a small fairground set up in a city-centre shop-space during a school holiday, alongside circus skills sessions and other activities for young people.\nA company held activities in seven unused shops in another UK city, including photography exhibitions and musical performances. More than 4,000 people visited the area over one weekend.\nIn a third city, a local company established a university drop-in shop in the main shopping street: it offered advice about studying, fees and funding and ran a free legal-advice clinic. Another empty property showcased the work of local artists, attracting over 10,000 visitors in four months. Local designers benefitted from affordable space, workshops and retail experience.\nCould this scheme be adapted for \"shopping paradise\" Hong Kong? Certain areas seem ideal for such projects, and with government assistance our malls and shopping streets could become places where we exchange ideas and learn new skills, as well as do our shopping."

Below are four examples:\n| Food | Description | Eatable rating |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Thousand-year-old eggs | Duck eggs are buried in clay, sand and salt for a couple of months, melting their insides to jelly. The yolk turns a dark green and smells like it has been around for 1000 years. | 4/10 |\n| Chicken feet | These wrinkled, claw-like chicken feet look like something from a witch's pot! Luckily, they taste better than they look although there isn't much meat and is mostly just skin! | 6/10 |\n| Sea slugs | You'd think sea slugs would be slimy and slightly rubbery and you'd be right! Sea slugs have a slippery texture and beginners should try them fried on a bed of noodles or rice with an accompanying sauce. | 3/10 |\n| Turtle soup | Turtles are boiled for up to twelve hours, mixed with herbs and then served as a type of jelly-like soup. The attraction here is the medicinal benefits, certainly not the taste, which is horrible! | 1/10 |"

Once a month, it organises a \"photography race\" event. \"In teams of two, the challenge is to take five photographs under four different themes over a seven-hour period,\" explains club founder Miranda Legg. Because the themes for each photo are random and must be picked up at the home base one-by-one, it means a lot of running around town while carrying a heavy camera. By the end, you'll be fit and have a collection of great photos from around the city.\nNot that we need studies to tell us this, but a UK study last year showed that doing your own chores - that's vacuuming, laundry, sweeping the floor, taking out the trash - can result in up to 50,000 calories burned per year (playing tennis once a week burns only 26,000 per year).\nThe art of lion dancing is an exciting, exhausting, leisure activity. So get a good workout - and pick up a kung fu move or two - by taking a lion dancing training course courtesy of the Hong Kong Chinese Martial Arts Dragon and Lion Dancing Association."

Cyber crimes could be identity theft, loss of ATM or bank passwords, or even financial losses when criminals use your account to buy expensive things online! According to the government, the number of reported cyber crimes in Hong Kong in 2009 was 1,506, but it had risen to 2,206 by 2011.\nThese statistics are unsurprising. Some of the world's 25 most common passwords in 2012 were \"password\", \"123456\", \"abc123\", and even \"monkey\"! Experts say passwords like these - which are so easy to guess - make a cyber criminal's job even easier, allowing them to steal vital personal information by breaking into users' accounts. Additionally, people do not change their passwords regularly because they think it is hard to remember a long or unique password.\nExperts suggest the following steps to protect yourself from cyber crime:\n1. Never use public computers to access emails or bank accounts because there could be a \"virus\" installed to copy your password(s).\n2. Never use the same password for all or most of your online accounts.\n3. Never store important information, such as passwords, on your mobile phone.\n4. Change your passwords regularly.\n5. Set complex passwords."

      "Below is an extract from an online article about \"cruel foods\":\nBy the time that cheeseburger arrives on your plate, it's hard to think about anything but how tasty it'll be. But when you trace the origins of each ingredient - the beef, the fried egg, the yummy bacon - some uncomfortable truths emerge. Below are three examples of the cruelest foods you can eat.\n| Food | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lobsters | A recent study reveals that, contrary to previous thinking, lobsters and crabs can feel pain and show signs of stress. Lobsters are usually boiled alive, and some Japanese restaurants even serve live lobster sashimi where you choose your lobster from a tank and it appears on your plate in seconds, slit down the middle and squirming. |\n| Shark's fin soup | This soup is made with fins that are sliced off sharks in open water. The shark is then tossed back into the water, leaving the animal to drown or bleed to death. Many of the fins served come from endangered shark species. More status symbol than nutritious, shark's fin soup is a popular gourmet dish throughout Asia. |\n| Goose liver | The French make a delicacy called \"foie gras\" which is goose liver that tastes very creamy. The creaminess comes from the goose being forced to eat large amounts of corn which is pushed down its throat through a long metal tube. After a month of force-feeding, the animal is killed and its unnaturally enlarged liver is served. |"

      "Below is some information from the internet about contact sports:\nThe term \"contact sport\" is used to describe sports in which players have physical contact with an opponent. Contact between players can be divided into different levels.\n- **Full contact sport**: Any sport in which physical contact with an opponent is allowed. In rugby and American football, players can tackle another player to the ground or use their body to block a player running on the field.\n- **Limited-contact sports**: Sports in which the rules are specifically designed to prevent contact between players. Although contact can happen, penalties are used to reduce contact between players. Examples include basketball, field hockey, netball and squash.\n- **Non-contact sports**: Sports where participants take turns competing or are physically separated to make it nearly impossible for them to make contact during the course of a game. Examples include sports such as golf, tennis, volleyball, swimming and gymnastics.\nIn recent years, there has been a growing perception that full contact sports are brutal, prone to violence and tend to cause injuries. This has led to a trend to decrease the amount of aggression and rough play in sports. Full contact, however, is seen as a major component in some sports such as rugby and is unlikely to ever be removed."

Whenever I want fresh and safe food I harvest whatever I need from my farm. This is a quality life. Everyone is able to live it, but many can't leave the city, which is too convenient for them.\"\nMok doesn't care much about what he earns, as long as it covers his expenses and rent. \"The more money you make, the more you want,\" he says, \"which pressures you to get more.

But scientists point to an unexpected side effect: when people keep their brains busy with digital input, they are sacrificing \"quiet time\" that could allow them to better learn and remember information, or come up with new ideas.\n\"Almost certainly, resting the brain lets it go over experiences it's had, solidify them and turn them into permanent long-term memories,\" said Loren Frank, a specialist in learning and memory. He believes that when the brain is constantly stimulated, you prevent this learning process.\nAt the University of Michigan, a study found that people learned significantly better after a walk in nature than after a walk in a dense urban environment, suggesting that processing a barrage of information leaves people fatigued.\nEven though people feel entertained, even relaxed, when they pass a moment at the bus stop by catching a quick video clip, they might be over-tiring their brains, scientists say."

Clutter takes up valuable space - not just in your surroundings, but in your head as well. Of the two, the psychological effect of clutter is more important: According to an expert, \"When we clear the clutter out of a space, people breathe a sigh of relief. People feel lighter, more at peace, more focused.\"\nExperts believe this is because the human brain is not equipped to deal with so much stimulation. If there's stuff everywhere you look, you are more likely to become stressed out and anxious. Clear out and organise your environment, and your mind can handle more things. Yes, there are physical dangers to clutter - you can easily trip and fall over things left on the floor. However, the psychological effects of clutter appear to be more serious because clutter could make you depressed without you realising it. A messy room is not a pleasant room.\nClearing the clutter and becoming organised is not easy. That's because a lot of what we hold on to is weighed down by emotional baggage. People have a strong attachment to their stuff. It carries memories and feelings, reminds them of things they don't do anymore, things that upset them at one time or made them happy."

Seriously, that's what the organisers are claiming and they have the support of industry professionals. From the official Mars One site:\nThe first crew of four astronauts will establish the first human settlement on Mars by 2023. A new team of four will join the settlement every two years. By 2033 there will be over twenty people living and working on Mars. This will be a one-way trip - the Mars astronauts will wave goodbye to their family and friends forever.\nA manned mission to Mars is one of the most exciting, inspiring and ambitious adventures that mankind can have. We see this as a journey that belongs to us all. The entire world will be able to watch and help with decisions as the settlers are selected, follow their extensive training for the mission and of course watch them living on Mars. The mission will provide invaluable scientific and social knowledge that will be accessible to everyone.\nWell what do you think - stupid idea to promote a TV show, or might they really manage it?"

Who has not felt pain and sadness when a loved character dies? Who has not felt fear when facing the final battle?\nAre movies considered art? YES. Music compositions, paintings, novels? YES. Then what are video games? They are much more than art. They are a perfect mixture of graphical art, musical soundtracks, gripping stories and one thing missing from traditional art forms: INTERACTIVITY.

According to the report, the hormone oxytocin, which is released during moments of romantic or familial love, is also released when dog owners play with their pets. Some female dog owners say their dog-owning experiences have led them to decide on whether or not to raise children. In a significant 2012 survey, 16% of Hongkongers questioned said they would prefer keeping pets to having kids, a number which is seemingly rising.\nMedia reports estimate that it costs up to HK$4 million to raise a child in Hong Kong. Owning a dog obviously costs less, but for some owners money is no question when it comes to the health and safety of their pets, easily spending $23,000 a year.\nIndeed, new businesses are thriving from dog-mania: whilst canine fashion is commonplace, Hong Kong now has restaurants that host dog birthday parties, salons for giving fashionable haircuts to dogs, and even psychologists who specialise in treating dogs."

It has been the fruit of the hard work of countless singers. We grew up with Cantopop. It is our collective memory.\nHowever, concerns have recently been voiced by industry experts that the impact of Cantopop is fading from Hong Kong's popular culture.\nThe emergence of new media such as mobile phones and the Internet has both allowed music from abroad to flood Hong Kong and encouraged the illegal downloading of music. These damaging activities have forced down music sales from HK$17 billion in 2002 to HK$0.56 billion in 2012.\nMeanwhile, the entertainment industries of neighboring regions have made great advances since the 1980s, and singers from the Mainland and Taiwan have grown in popularity. K-Pop and J-Pop (from Korea and Japan) are also massively popular. This means Cantopop is now less dominant in Asia.\nFinally, it has often been said that Cantopop content has been over-focused towards love songs for young people. Unlike in the 1970s-1990s, this limited range is failing to attract a diverse audience and so is ignoring older generations. Is Cantopop destined to disappear in the next generation?"

The need for acceptance, approval, and belonging amongst friends is vital during the teen years. This makes them more vulnerable to the influences of their peers - which can be positive or negative. Positive peer pressure is when teens follow their friends to do well, such as studying hard in school. Negative peer pressure is when teens are more likely to engage in negative behaviours like drug use or shoplifting in order to fit in with a group.\nDifferent factors cause teens to react to peer pressure in different ways. Gender, age and whether they feel rejected by their peers or family are some factors. For example, boys give in more easily to peer pressure than girls, particularly in dangerous situations. Younger teens are more easily influenced than older teens, with peer pressure at its highest when they are 14-16 years old. Individual characteristics such as confidence level, personality and degree of maturity also make a difference."

      "Below is an extract from a magazine about \"emotional traps\":\nWorking in groups is common in school - whether conducting experiments together, working on homework assignments, or co-operating during extra-curricular activities. Sometimes in the group, we meet people who are difficult to work with and we end up arguing with them. We get angry and frustrated, falling into something which experts call an \"emotional trap\" that prevents us from achieving success when working together.\nEmotional traps are negative emotions caused by something small like a group member annoying you, or something big like fighting with a friend. It is easy to fall into emotional traps; the key is how you react when someone upsets you, through a process called \"unhooking\". Unhooking means freeing yourself from all sorts of emotional traps.\nThere are three steps to unhooking. First, unhook physically by doing something physical to release the negative energy to calm down, for instance, running, walking or simply splashing water on your face. Secondly, unhook mentally by examining the facts of the situation objectively, instead of emotionally. For example, instead of focusing on how upset you are at the situation, focus on what the solutions are to the situation. Lastly, unhook verbally by not blaming or scolding people, which could cause more conflicts or arguments.\nUnhook yourself from emotional traps today!"

      "Below is an extract from a newspaper article about eye colour and Asia's definition of beauty:\nOf all the different eye colours, blue appears to be the most desirable as there is a popular belief that people with blue eyes are considered \"good-looking\". To cater to this desire, there are contact lenses in different colours (like green and blue) to allow people to have an eye colour of their choice. Coloured contact lenses are popular in many parts of Asia, especially in Japan and Korea, where it is not uncommon to see girls with dyed blonde hair wearing blue contact lenses.\nAccording to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, South Korea has the highest cosmetic surgery statistics in the world, including eye surgery to make people's eyes larger. This has caused debates as to whether Asians believe that Caucasian eyes are more beautiful. Some say that Asians are just trying to conform to a global beauty standard, whilst others argue that Asians are striving to appear more Caucasian, since they see this as an ideal form of beauty.\nNow, it seems that a doctor in America is able to permanently change the colour of one's eyes - from brown to blue! Using a laser treatment lasting only 20 seconds, the laser energy is absorbed by the eye's brown pigment, causing the pigment tissue to change, effectively changing brown eyes to blue within two to three weeks. This procedure is pending approval and costs US$5,000."

Studies have shown that because current rules allow schools to introduce calculators freely from the age of seven, 98% of 10-year-olds in England rely on calculators in Maths lessons - far higher than the global average of 46%.\nSchools will have to avoid introducing calculators until the final year of primary school, when most children are 10 years old. Calculators will also be banned in national tests for 11-year-olds. The government hopes that this will end the habit of \"simply reaching for the calculator\" to work out basic sums (such as 900 minus 452). According to reports, students in Singapore, Hong Kong and Massachusetts, where calculators are already banned in Maths classes in primary schools, currently outperform pupils in England in Maths at the ages of 10 and 14.\n\"All young children should be confident with methods of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division before they pick up the calculator to work out more complex sums. By banning calculators in Maths tests, we will reduce the dependency on them in the classroom for the most basic sums. Children will have a solid grounding in the basics so they can grow up to be comfortable with the Maths they will need in their adult lives,\" says an English official."

What happens next will change his life forever and put his family and friends in great danger. Saving his loved ones and surviving the war will take all of Paolo's courage.\n*Hero* is a very tense and vivid tale focusing on one boy and his family. Paolo is a lively and totally believable character. It is a thrilling and emotional novel about war, but also about courage and love in the face of terrible danger and hardship. The author was influenced to write this story by real-life accounts, stories of courage and suffering from actual people.\nThe scene-setting and character detail help to make the book excellent. The hero on a bicycle is an ordinary boy, but his story is certainly not ordinary. This is a novel well worth searching out on bookshop shelves overcrowded with books about wizards, vampires and magic. Strongly recommended as a thrilling and original read."

      "Below is an extract from a website about email:\n**Why Are Young People Abandoning Email?**\nHaving an email account used to be cool. You could send people in Africa your thoughts on a new K-Pop song, receive email confirmation for movie tickets you bought on the phone and ignore scam messages. Not anymore. Why? New York Times technology writer Matt Richtel has a theory - email just isn't cool anymore. An email account in the year 2014 is a \"sign you're old. It's the technology your Dad uses\". And, as we all know, the last thing a teenager wants to be is like his Dad. It also requires a \"boringly long process of signing into an account, typing out a subject line and then sending a message that might not be received or answered for hours\",\nTeens, needless to say, do not have time for this sort of nonsense. As Ken Kampu, a 17-year-old student from Nairobi writes, \"I don't use email for casual correspondence, why would I? It's too formal and unnecessary, it would be like writing your friend a long letter asking if they wanted to get coffee next Tuesday.\" Which is probably why, as Richtel notes, the \"number of visitors in the United States to major e-mail sits like Yahoo! and Hotmail is now in steady decline, peaking as long ago as November 2009\"\nYahoo! Senior Director of Product Management David McDowel, however, points out many email functions (attachments, cc lines) are not designed for teenagers anyway. Maybe they'll come around when they enter the workplace."

I believe helicopter parenting can be a good thing for younger children. However, others think that helicopter parents create conditions that make it difficult for their kids to succeed.\nOur job as parents is to protect our kids and give them the tools they need to both survive and succeed in the real world. We all want our kids to grow up to be productive members of society. No one wants to be the parent who suffocates their kid. Our role is to protect them 24 hours a day, seven days a week when they first come into the world and then gradually ease off, giving them more and more freedom and responsibility as they prove ready for the task. And while kids fight for more freedom, it is ultimately up to the parent to decide what they are ready to handle on their own.\nWe all look down on parents who are not involved enough with their kids, who don't send enough time teaching them. The danger with helicopter parents is when they don't allow their own kids to make decisions to keep themselves safe. Those are the kids who grow up to be kids unable to make good choices and unable to protect themselves from their own stupidity."

However, some argue that its child-centred approach has gone too far and children now rule the family instead of parents. A psychiatrist who wrote the book \"How Children Took Power\" says parents should listen to their children but Swedish children now tend to decide everything in families: when to go to bed, what to eat, where to go on vacation, even what to watch on TV.\nHe adds that not disciplining Swedish children or setting boundaries from a young age has led them to have expectations that are too high, and they think that life is too hard for them. This has resulted in a sharp increase of anxiety problems, self-harming and children being unprepared for adulthood. Teachers have complained that students have become bad mannered and uncontrollable, frequently using foul language and not caring about schoolwork. Another expert feels because of Sweden's emphasis on democracy and equality, Swedish parents try to be too democratic. Parents should act like parents and not act like friends. They should make decisions, take control, and not try to be popular all the time.\nNonetheless, some people feel that the Swedish parenting style is successful. Swedish children are very outspoken and can express their opinions well. On the whole, Swedish youths still top international rankings of well-being."

It also gave me a chance to perform different types of dance such as Hip Hop, Jazz, Funk and Modern Dance.\nI was in the dance group for three years and it was truly a unique experience. I didn't just learn dance steps and techniques, I also made friends and became myself. For this, I have to give credit to my dance teachers who also became my life teachers. I learnt so much from them, both about dance and self-awareness. Apart from teaching me about performing on stage, they also kept asking me, \"What are you doing here? Who are you? Why do you perform? Is it just for yourself or are you trying to attract attention?\"\nThose questions meant a lot to me as I was growing up and I have asked myself the same questions many times. As a teenager, dance was transformative and helped me to find myself. I now understand that I dance not to please the audience. I dance for myself. I dance because I am."

      "Below is an extract from an online article about taking photos of food:\n**Crazy about food photos!**\nYears ago, if you took out a camera to take pictures of your food, or your friend's food, people might have laughed at you. Nowadays, more and more people are taking food photos and uploading them on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. But according to a mental health expert, Dr. Valerie Taylor, photographing food is an indication of mental illness and of health problems. She says that those who constantly take pictures of what they're eating usually have some type of unhealthy relationship between food and their weight.\n\"We take pictures of things that are important to us, and for some people, the food itself becomes central and the rest - the venue, the company, etc. - is background,\" Dr. Taylor says. Obsessing about food photography could lead to \"unhealthy weight disorders\".\nHowever, others feel that taking photos of food could also suggest one's eagerness to share with others what one has eaten or the celebration of one's passion. Some also feel that a picture speaks a thousand words, and so a picture of last night's dinner might best describe an incredible meal. It is also sometimes fun to take pictures of strange foods (e.g. grasshoppers covered in chocolate), or the food you encounter when you are travelling to keep a memory of that moment."

And yet youngsters who enjoy dancing in the street or doing tricks with their skateboards at night are sometimes still dismissed as \"troublemakers\" and \"youths at risk\". Yeung Kin-tong, a social worker at the Chai Wan Centre of the Chinese YMCA of Hong Kong, is familiar with such negative labels.\n\"People see kids hanging out at night and think they are troublemakers. But the truth is they can only enjoy their hobby at night, when there are fewer people around,\" Yeung says. \"They are not making trouble; they are trying to avoid it.\" Yeung started interacting with youths who began dancing and skateboarding on the street a decade ago. She adds that Hongkongers have come a long way in recognising the value of street culture.\n\"People used to frown upon teens on skateboards. They did not respect it as sport. Same with street dancing or graffiti. People did not consider them as art. But that was in the past, now people understand more about street culture,\" she says. Yeung cites the Hong Kong International Street Jam Festival held on April 19 at Victoria Park, which was the first government-sponsored street culture event, \"Street culture is gaining recognition,\" she says."

In fact, Switzerland was ranked the world's 3rd happiest country in the United Nations' 2013 World Happiness Report, while Hong Kong was ranked 64th (out of 156 countries).\nSo what's Switzerland's secret? The tiny European country - with a small population and very few natural resources - is known for investing in its people. Switzerland invests more in the health, education and talent of its people than any other country in the world. This has led to an economy that is competitive, highly innovative and an educated society that has adopted technology quickly. Below are four things we can learn from Switzerland.\n1. Excellent healthcare. With a high-quality healthcare system that provides universal coverage, the Swiss live longer, are emotionally and physically healthy, and thus feel better.\n2. High-quality education. 86% of adults aged 25-64 in Switzerland have earned a high school diploma, and the Swiss also have higher average test scores in literacy, math and science.\n3. Talent and innovation. Switzerland is number one in the world for innovation, on-the-job staff training, attracting talent from elsewhere and government-funded training. The Swiss are well-paid and retain their own talent.\n4. Well-developed infrastructure. The Swiss have created an efficient transportation system and excellent Internet connectivity."

Since then, it has become an archive for any new term or slang word, particularly those used to describe the behaviour and activities that have arisen because of social media and the web. More than 7 million entries are listed on the site and 2,000 definitions are added daily and it has become the default dictionary for many users.\nThe Urban Dictionary documents words, photos and videos posted on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc. with words/phrases that would not be found in a standard dictionary. Anyone can add a word, no matter how offensive or controversial. Submissions are approved and rated by volunteers and visitors to the website. Mr Peckham said that he rarely edits or removes words unless they reveal someone's private information. Because Urban Dictionary's users contribute and vote on which definitions are most popular, it says something about our current culture - something that traditional dictionaries can't do.\nPeople have always been inventive with language,\" said Katherine Connor Martin, the head of U.S. Dictionaries at Oxford University Press. 'In the 19th century, if young people were using slang terms among themselves, those words had to become very well entrenched before anything came into popular use,' she added. \"Now, if someone invents a new word on Twitter, it can go viral.\""

The wheel will reach 60 metres into the sky, carrying passengers in air-conditioned gondolas. It is estimated that about 2,000 people will ride on weekdays and 4,000 on weekends and public holidays. Each ride could last 10 to 15 minutes, with a fare of about HK$100.\nSupporters of the plan say that Hong Kong would benefit from adding a ferris wheel to its skyline. \"It will offer a unique experience that both locals and tourists can enjoy.\"\nBut not everyone is convinced that a ferris wheel will be good for Hong Kong. Lawmaker Paul Tse stressed Hong Kong has very few tourist spots along the coast and that the Central waterfront is a prime location and very expensive. Hong Kong already has very good observation points on The Peak and Sky100 in Kowloon, where people can enjoy the view from both sides of the harbour.\nHis concerns are echoed in part by Paul Zimmerman of the Society for the Protection of the Harbour. He feels that Hong Kong should not be seen as a 'copycat' simply mimicking the London Eye and the Singapore Flyer, two ferris wheels which are bigger than the one proposed to be built in Hong Kong. \"I would rather the land is used for waterfront restaurants or a kids' playground.\""

However, when it came to Facebook, 75% of young people used Facebook while only 56% of parents used it.\nThe study also revealed that 13% of parents admitted using fake identities to check up on their children through Facebook. A further 6% used their children's username and password to access their social media accounts.\nWhen interviewed, parents explained that they wanted to monitor their children's online activities, but had to create fake identities because children tended to set a level of privacy to exclude their parents. Children, however, did not like parents checking up on them. One reason given for not wanting to have parents as Facebook \"friends\" was because their parent might embarrass them by posting awkward comments or baby photos online.\nNot all children felt this way, though. One S6 student said that she had no problems with her parents as Facebook \"friends\" because they already knew everything about her."

There are hundreds of websites and blogs available on the web for people to visit to help them learn how to use coupons effectively, share deals, get advice and exchange information on tips and deals.\nWhen I am asked \"doesn't couponing seem like a full time job to you?\", my response is \"it is my job to save my family money on groceries and other things.\" When I first started couponing I spent a fair amount of time each week cutting, organizing, researching deals, etc. but it was not long before I got the hang of it and had a system! Now a couple of hours a week accomplishes my money saving goals!\nI actually feel couponing is a hobby more than a job because hobbies are something people do because they enjoy it. I enjoy using coupons! It is exciting to see how much you saved at the end of a shopping trip just as a person would be excited seeing a completed hobby project!\nWhen I started couponing I was a single mother of four young children and had just lost my job. It was not a hobby to start cutting costs, it was an absolute necessity. Although I am no longer a single mother, saving money is still a necessity. The fact is, no matter what your financial situation is, coupons can help save money to let you achieve your goals!"

After he witnessed the death of his parents, he dedicated his life to being a crime fighter. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers. He makes use of his intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth and martial arts to fight against crime.\n**Sailor Moon**\nSailor Moon is a typical 14-year old who likes sleeping late and playing video games. Bunny (or Usagi in Japanese), like many superheroes before her, one day discovers she has great magical powers. Wearing a distinctive costume, she races off to save the world from various bad guys, discovering inner strength she never knew she had and... saving the day!\n**Monkey King**\nIf you think Superman or Spiderman has been around for a long time, think about Monkey King. He has been China's favourite superhero for at least five centuries. He's amazingly strong, he can fly, and he has a few tricks those other superheroes have never heard of. And he's always ready to do battle with demons, dragons and sometimes even the gods."

He has an extraordinary track record and has named 60 species so far - more than any other researcher in his field. And he is only 43 years old.\nXu didn't set out to be a dinosaur hunter; in fact, he had no idea what a dinosaur was until he entered university. Initially, Xu wanted to study economics, but in those days, students were not allowed to choose their degree. For reasons that are unclear to him, he was assigned 'Palaeontology', the study of fossils.\nWhile he was working on his master's degree, the small number of dinosaur species which were being discovered in China grew rapidly. Funding was increasing; farmers started recognizing the value of the fossils they found; and construction meant that new fossils were being unearthed more frequently.\nFossils are now a thriving business as well as a science in China. Dinosaur hunters often have to have good relationships with farmers, museum directors and the tourism bureau to gain access to fossil sites. One of Xu's concerns is the fossil 'grey market', where people try and sell fake bones or buy real ones and keep them in their private collection.\nXu says, \"When I started my career, I never expected that I would have made so many discoveries, It's a job that requires a lot of hard work and luck."

Showering every day A daily hot shower using harsh, dry soaps can be bad for your skin. \"Using hot water combined with harsh soaps can remove the skin's oils and moisture, resulting in dryness, cracking and even infection of the skin,\" said a doctor.\n2. Sleeping too little Getting less than 6-8 hours of sleep a day greatly affects your health, no matter how much you exercise. Scientists have discovered that those who skipped sleep increased their risk of stroke and heart disease by 400%.\n3. Carrying a heavy bag Carrying a heavy schoolbag or handbag around can really hurt your health by causing back pains, neck problems and poor posture, according to experts.\n4. Over-exercising It's wrong to think that the more time we spend exercising, the better our health. Working your body too hard can lead to a weaker immune system, muscle damage, and knee, foot, or back problems.\n5. Skipping breakfast Skipping breakfast not only makes you feel tired and less active, it is also linked with a higher risk of diabetes and can lead to obesity as your body stores up more fat to use as energy throughout the rest of the day."

Not only that, the training can be very tough, requiring long hours of practice. Additionally, in individual sports (like tennis, squash, etc.), it can be quite lonely sometimes without having teammates to train with. It might also be difficult to handle failure in competitions too. Is it worth pursuing sports then? Most definitely yes, especially playing in team sports (like football, volleyball, etc.).\nThere are certainly many well-known benefits of physical activity and sports in general. However, playing team sports provides extra benefits. Being part of a team demands commitment, punctuality, encouraging your teammates, and team-work. Team sports also mean that young people can make friends outside of school and learn how to work towards achieving a common goal.\nAccording to a research study in ScienceDaily last year, a Youth Risk Behaviour survey was conducted on 1,820 high school students in America. Researchers found that playing team sports could reduce bullying and violence in everyday life. The findings indicated that boys who played team sports were less bullied than boys in individual sports. Boys who did not participate in any sport experienced the most bullying.

University students borrow, on average, HK$109,000 in government loans, while students taking sub-degree and private degree courses borrow HK$192,000.\nThe survey involving 727 students who have unpaid loans was carried out from late August to mid-September by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups (HKFYG). About 65 percent of students have taken up at least one part-time job over the past year, working for an average of 33.8 hours per week. Just about 10 percent of students said they were confident about paying off their debt on time, while most expect they would still be repaying well into their 30s.\nThe most expensive fees are for private degrees, which can cost as much as HK$90,000 a year. Student loans have an annual interest rate of 1.4 percent, which must be repaid within 15 years after the student graduates. Asked whether they thought they faced financial pressure, students gave an average rating of 7.31 out of a scale of 10, with 10 being \"intense pressure\".\nAmy Fung Dun-mi, Vice-President of HKFYG, suggests the government should get rid of interest rates and subsidise more degree places, while private institutions should offer more scholarships."

Researchers have discovered that the faces on LEGO Minifigures are becoming increasingly angry and less happy. Combined with a trend towards more war-related LEGO themes, a team led by Christoph Bartneck at the University of Canterbury said, \"We cannot help but wonder how this impacts how children play.\"\nThe influence of LEGO is huge. The product is sold in more than 130 countries and the company produced more than 36 billion lego bricks in 2010 alone. On average each person on earth owns approximately 75 lego bricks. The vast majority of LEGO figures have happy faces (324), but the next most common is anger (192), followed by sadness (49), disgust (28), surprise (23) and fear (11). And the trend is for an increasing proportion of angry faces, with a reduction in happy faces.\nBartneck's team also observed that LEGO has a considerable range of weapon systems in their products and that the company is moving towards more war-based play themes. Together with the rising numbers of angry faces, the researchers warned that LEGO might not be able to hold onto its highly positive reputation. The children that grow up with LEGO today will remember not only smileys, but also anger and fear in the Minifigures' faces."

When we get up in the morning and turn on the television or the radio, there will be anywhere from 15 to 25 commercials. As we travel to school or work, we will be exposed to billboards, signage, business logos, advertisements on other vehicles, etc. which will add another 10 to 20 ads.\nUnfortunately, a lot of the messages that we are being exposed to may be less than honest. A good example of this comes in the form of weight loss supplements. They proclaim, \"Take these pills and you will lose weight 30 percent faster without diet or exercise.\" Others say, \"These pills work uniquely with a woman's body to increase the amount of weight loss.\" Unfortunately about 95 percent of all of the diet programs are not as effective as advertised.\nThe success of a product does not rely only on its advertising but also on its quality. Many advertising campaigns fail because the product doesn't deliver on the promises made in the advertisements. Companies are well advised not to exaggerate or over-promise, since advertising can only make people buy the product the first time. Once customers discover the product is not good, they will not buy it again."

After generations of staying slim on small portions of rice, noodles and vegetables, there is a growing trend in Japan of copying western-style big meals - known as ohmori (oh-mo-ri) or \"large serving\". Ohmori meals are increasingly popular, with delighted customers photographing their food and posting it online.\nOne of Japan's largest web forums has encouraged users to upload their favourite images of mega 'ohmori' or mega large meals. Amongst the favourites is a sushi roll (picture 1) stuffed with large chunks of fish which looks like it could easily feed a family of four! Picture 2 shows just how huge the pile of noodles is.\nMany restaurants are now cashing in on the craze, using particularly huge stacks of food as publicity stunts to attract customers. However, such enthusiasm for stomach-bursting meals may be risky, especially since it is considered extremely rude in Japan not to finish everything on your plate or to waste food. It would certainly be most challenging trying to eat everything!"

      "Below is an extract from a newspaper article about a Hong Kong teenager:\n**From Hong Kong to Hollywood!**\nWhen 16-year-old Jeremy Lin started writing a comedy based on his own personal experiences in school in Hong Kong, he did not expect Hollywood to pick up his script and turn it into a 90-minute film. \"I'm just some kid who wrote something and then they wanted to make it into a movie,\" said the Year 11 pupil studying at an international school.\nJeremy first submitted a proposal for a movie to a Los Angeles-based screenwriter and investor, Ms. Fabienne Wen, at a film workshop in 2012. After Ms. Wen read the proposal, she encouraged him to write a full-length script, which he finished in 2013. Impressed, Ms. Wen brought the script to Hollywood's attention. This then started a price war among movie executives wanting to produce the film. Studio Best Medicine Production won. Angel Gracia, who directed the 2011 romantic comedy From Prada to Nada, will be the director for the film.\nThe movie, called Senior Project, is aimed at teenagers and set in America. The plot revolves around five high-school students, including a teenager who lies about his sexuality and a student who tries to keep up the appearance of being rich. Jeremy is now one of the world's youngest screenwriters and a local teenager who dared to dream big."

      "Below is an extract from an online article about technology:\n**Warning signs you are addicted to technology**\nToday, it is virtually impossible to live without the aid of some form of technology like smartphones, the internet, computers etc.). This makes it extremely difficult to escape from technology. As work, school and play can all involve computers and the internet, normal computer usage levels become more intense each year. In 2013, the average student in America aged 8-18 spent more than 7.5 hours a day involved with non-school-related technology!\nBelow are some signs that might indicate that you are addicted to technology:\n1. Increasing your time spent daily on computer and internet activities that are not related to work or school.\n2. Feeling very anxious or distressed when separated from technology (e.g., not being able to check emails, surf the internet, send mobile text messages etc.).\n3. Multi-tasking by using multiple forms of technology at one time (e.g., playing computer games while watching TV and listening to music etc.), which could lead to a lack of concentration.\n4. Losing confidence and interest in the real world while choosing the comfort of a virtual world, thus sacrificing time spent with friends and family, or even skipping school.\nWe certainly can't live without technology today. The key is finding the balance between our constant need to engage with technology without becoming digital slaves."

However, cases of bad customer service are becoming more frequent.\nThere was the case of the waiter who angrily said again and again, \"THERE ARE NO MORE SEATS\" when I wanted to book a table. \"What about the waiting list?\" I asked. He said that there was no room on the waiting list. Then there was the case when I called a company and had to go through their automated phone system and it took forever to get my question answered. It was only after a very long wait that I was able to finally speak with an actual person. When I finally got someone on the phone, they acted as though they were doing me a favor by answering my inquiry.\nTo improve customer service, the major focus has to be placed on the employees to make sure they are treated equally and that they work in an environment that is motivating, inspiring and encouraging. Employees should be given a word of praise whenever possible. Every attempt possible should be made to motivate employees by rewarding them for a difficult job done well. With these measures in place, we should see world class customer service return to Hong Kong once again."

Children armed with backpacks come out of their homes and go to the village community hall, where they are watched by village headmen. They take out schoolbooks and pencils with one mission - to study. \"This is a call to my beloved children, that from 7-9pm, Study Time is in effect. May you become clever children, disciplined and focused,\" he yells alongside parent volunteers on study patrol.\nThis unique scheme - to get children (aged 7 to 18) to stay indoors and study - began in September 2013. The move was to stop a growing number of student fights and prevent children from aimlessly hanging around in groups on the streets at night. Children can choose to study in a common space or at home. Those caught not studying have to pay a 2,000 rupiah (HK$2) fine, a heavy amount for some families. So far, no fines have been collected because parents are very keen on this scheme.\nVolunteers help the children with a variety of subjects, like English, making them write words in Bahasa Indonesia and then translate them into English. Older children help the younger children too.\nWith its success, the study curfew has spread to other provinces across Indonesia, where residents have embraced this community effort."

Stand your phone up on this stand and click away. It's small and easy to carry around.\n- **Selfy iOS**: Selfy iOS (HK$8, available at itunes.apple.com) provides a similar service to Selfie Shutter, by giving you a timer. As an added bonus, it comes with a built-in effects editor. Android users might want to look at the free app, YouCam, which offers a similar set of features.\n- **Selfie Stick**: If you're looking to take group shots or simply want to take in more of the view behind you, try one of these selfie sticks (HK$350, DG Lifestyle Store, Pacific Place, Admiralty). It is highly portable, only 23cm long and when extended reaches 93cm. Pair with Selfy iOS or YouCam and you should have the perfect selfie set-up.\n- **N1 Mini**: The N1 Mini (HK$4,000) is a smartphone for selfie fans which has a rotating camera with a 195-degree angle. Its main purpose seems to be to get a better angle of yourself without moving your hand. For any selfie obsessives, the \"beautify\" mode will give you a slimmer face and clearer skin.\nAs members of your school's Photography Club,"

      "**Digital Memory Boxes**\nA decade from now, if all goes well, a spacecraft with a high-tech drill will land at the South Pole of the moon. There, it will drill up to 100 feet down into the surface and collect rock samples to bring back to Earth. These samples will hopefully answer questions like \"What are the origins of the moon?... Is the moon suitable for a permanent manned base for space exploration?\"\nBefore the spacecraft leaves, it will bury a two-part time capsule: a public part, full of Earth's history and a private part, full of \"digital memory boxes\" created by individuals and schools.\nBritish engineer, David Iron, who came up with the plan said, \"We have carried out research and been quite surprised how keen people are. School kids think the idea of having a bit of themselves on the moon is fantastic.\"\nBy donating HK$1000 you can be one of the first to reserve yourself a Digital Memory Box. Think of it like an iPod or memory stick: into your memory box, you will be able to upload whatever digital information you want: a personal message, a photo, a family tree, a poem, a video, your favourite song... the choice is yours! Millions of individual memory boxes, belonging to people and schools all over the world, will make up the private archive - to be buried deep inside the moon.\nYour school has decided to send a digital memory box to the moon.

There are dollhouses and hand-made dresses for dolls, with matching bonnets and pants. Prices for dolls start at around AUD$20 (around HK$140), for a regular doll, to thousands for a rare collector's doll.\nSo if you have a precious doll or bear stuffed in a cupboard, maybe injured, aged and a little neglected, it's time to take them to Sydney's Famous Original Doll Hospital, and ensure they will be passed on and loved for many years to come.\nYou and"

The program would be rolled out slowly over two semesters giving teachers and students time to adjust to the change in policy.\n\"For our older students there is a policy right now of not using mobile devices, so we will have to have that debate about when it will be appropriate,\" said Jean Colley, a senior staff member of the school.\nFor the first semester, \"Bring Your Own Device\" will be implemented only in select classrooms where teachers have volunteered to test the program before it is introduced school-wide during the second semester.\nBoard Chairman Garry Carter said he hopes the program will be implemented carefully and that other methods of learning that have been so successful for so long will not be abandoned. Colley stressed that the devices would not take the place of traditional teaching with pencils and books.\n\"I don't think you'll see a classroom of students doing this,\" Colley said bowing her head with thumbs moving as if tapping out a text message. \"But I do think these devices will accelerate their learning.\"\nSchool Board member Anne Rollins said it is important the students learn to filter and synthesize the material they get online. \"The technology is going to give them data, but it's not going to think for them.\"\nIn"

London is the proposed city for this project, which could accommodate thousands of people - as well as schools, offices, shops and even parks.\nThe 'Endless City' project would see a giant 300m skyscraper built with its own complete ecosystem featuring offices, shops and 'huge parks. Residents would be able to walk around intertwining ramps in the interior of the giant building, passing through shopping, commercial and residential areas. The building would include many of the features that can be found in a city environment, such as public spaces, entertainment zones and shopping areas. Different areas of the building would be linked by a series of bridges and walkways helping to 'increase exchanges, communications and interactions' and the different levels will offer stunning views across London's skyline.\nThe proposal has been drawn up by SURE Architecture, whose design has already won the SkyScrapers and SuperSkyScrapers Competition. The firm insists the building would be a great space-saver in dense cities which have previously spread outwards rather than upwards. The architects hope the project will encourage people to think about \"vertical city designs\" that would, in the future, bring the feeling of a city inside a building, and residents would never have to leave."

      "**Online Writer Rises to Fame**\nThe Midnight After is a 2014 Hong Kong satirical horror comedy film directed by Fruit Chan and starring a wide cast of actors. The film is based on the web-novel, Lost on a Red Mini Bus to Taipo, by the 25-year-old Hong Kong writer nicknamed \"Mr. Pizza\", who first became famous on the Internet forum HKGolden.\nLost on a Red Mini Bus to Taipo is about a bunch of passengers who are lost in a parallel world - where the surroundings remain the same, yet all humans have disappeared. It was first serialized online from February to July 2012 and then published in book form in July 2012. Against all odds, the book, which contains adult themes and strong language, sold 30,000 copies at the Hong Kong Book Fair.\nPizza, who is a big fan of American writer Stephen King and the US television series Lost, decided to create his own sci-fi novel with a local touch. He wrote the novel using local slang to relate to the online community. The story became an instant hit and was one of the three bestsellers at the book fair.\nWhile Pizza welcomes feedback and criticism, some internet users left unreasonable and nasty comments. He admits that it took some time to get used to that aspect of writing online. He describes some of the hateful comments as \"like you are writing something in your room, but suddenly someone comes in and shouts at you in your face\".\nAs members of the school magazine, you are preparing for an article on how to be an online writer."

Here are some major findings:\n- **Question 1**: 59% of the employers said that they found it difficult to manage Gen Y staff because of the following:\n- Lack of loyalty\n- Unrealistic job expectations\n- Impatience\n- Need of constant attention\n- Little respect for authority\n- **Question 2**: The employers took the following measures to make their workplace more attractive to their Gen Y employees:\n- Setting up mentorship or coaching programmes\n- Encouraging own initiative and independent thinking\n- Allowing flexible working hours and more work-life balance\n- Adopting a more casual environment (e.g. wearing jeans and t-shirt or working from home)\nThe survey also found that members of Gen Y are tech-savvy and know how to use social media to gain opportunities.

The students - who are from different departments - collected environmental and ecological data to turn into creative art forms.\n\"The Antarctica expedition enables creative artists, researchers and scientists to work together, interpreting environmental data into interesting visuals such as animation, gaming and film,\" said team leader Prof. Scott Hessels. \"This once-in-a-lifetime trip will offer new insights into a sustainable future and help the public better understand environment issues.\"\nSome activities that students did in Antarctica included tracking and measuring changes in the body temperature of penguins; studying life in Antarctica; examining physical properties of icebergs; and collecting sound recordings of Antarctic winds.\nStudents had to prepare themselves physically and take first-aid courses, as well as obtain all necessary equipment. Another challenge was to raise HK$30,000 funding per person, which was 40% of the full cost per person, with university and external sponsorships covering the rest of the expenses.\nAs the Student Committee of your school's upcoming overseas study tour,"

      "In around 40 countries in the world today, young people (usually men) are required to spend one or two years in compulsory military service. Switzerland and South Korea are two such countries.\n- **Military service in Switzerland**: In 2013, 73% of Switzerland's voters voted to keep the country's compulsory military service. According to Swiss law, male citizens aged between 18 and 34 have to do four months of basic training in the army. About 20,000 men a year attend basic training as a soldier and must be ready for follow-up military training. Many young men complain that the months spent in the army are a waste of time, but older voters say this obligatory duty is the best way to defend the country. Some Swiss men refuse to fulfill their military duties and in this case they can choose to do non-military duties such as environmental projects or work with the elderly.\n- **Military service in South Korea**: In South Korea military service lasts as long as two years. Unlike Switzerland, young men who are fit and healthy cannot choose to serve the community instead. Recently, however, the Korean media has highlighted a number of controversial cases involving celebrities who have taken measures to avoid compulsory military service. In 2002, Yoo Seung Jun, a Korean pop singer, became an American citizen to avoid his military duty. Another recent example is MC Mong, a popular singer-rapper accused of avoiding his military service in Korea by having several healthy back teeth removed."

      "**Meals on Wheels**\nFriendly and attentive waiters are a key ingredient in the running of a successful restaurant. Now more and more robots are replacing humans by providing a reliable waitressing service in Chinese restaurants and hotels.\nOne such new restaurant in Jiangsu Province, China, is staffed by 15 robots that not only carry food to a diner's table, but help cook it too. The robots greet customers, deliver food and help with cooking in the kitchen and if they encounter a rude customer, there is no chance of them spitting in the food. Some of the robots can manage polite conversation, as well as greeting customers with 40 different phrases. Just like with humans, the energy-intensive job takes its toll on the robots, which are expected to offer between five and eight years' service. Each one costs around HK$50,000.\nAnother robot restaurant serving dumplings and noodles cooked by robots was recently set up in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province. When a diner walks into this restaurant, an usher robot says, \"Earth person hello. Welcome to the Robot Restaurant.\" There is even a singing robot to serenade diners.\nSimilar robots are also taking over small tasks in hotels. The Pengheng Space Capsules Hotel in Shenzhen has robotic receptionists and doormen as well as mechanical waiters. Because the robots are not paid a salary, a stay at the hotel is cheap at just HK$70 per night."

Just under half of them (48%) said being able to use the Internet was more essential than seeing their family. About 51% reported that they could go longer without seeing their friends than using their mobile phone.\nOne researcher, Katie Lomas, said the findings show the extent to which technology now dominates most people's essential daily routines. She said: \"What we believe to be essential is an extremely personal choice, and something that varies between individuals.

      "**WHAT IS UPCYCLING?**\nUpcycling is the process of converting waste materials or useless products into new materials or products of better quality or for better environmental value. When you upcycle an item, you aren't breaking down the materials. You may be refashioning it but it's still made of the same materials as when you started. Also, the upcycled item is typically better or the same quality as the original.\nUpcycling is not a new concept. Some of the best examples of upcycling come from the 1930s and 40s when families had very little economic or material resources. During that time, people reused almost everything, repurposing items over and over until they were no longer useful: feed sacks became dresses or old doors became the new dining room table. What was old was new again, but with a twist.\nOne of the biggest reasons for the rebirth of upcycling is the positive impact on the environment. Items destined for the dump are rescued and remade into something useful. When you upcycle, you remove items from the global garbage stream. Upcycling instead of recycling is good too; recycling requires energy or water to break down materials. Upcycling only requires your own creativity and upcycled products can rival those found in high-end department stores.\nExamples of items that can be upcycled are:\n- old tyres → chair\n- old t-shirts → cat tent\n- old books → lamp stand\nYour school has decided to organize an upcycling campaign. As part of the campaign"

      "A recent survey has shown that subjects like Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths - STEM for short - continue not to attract as many females as males. Hong Kong parents, for example, often discourage their daughters from pursuing STEM subjects. In Hong Kong universities, men still dominate these subjects. At the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology women make up just 21% of engineering students. A 2013 survey of 57 companies in Hong Kong showed that women represent fewer than 10% of IT staff at more than half the companies. In the US by 2020 there will be 1.4 million jobs in computing fields, but women are likely to fill only 3% of those jobs.\nGirls who show an early interest in STEM subjects often lose interest due to the male-dominated learning environment. A study from Britain shows that girls studying in single-sex schools are nearly 2 times more likely to study physics at A-level than if they had studied in mixed schools.\nWe should be showing young women that they can love science and maths. Without enough women in science and technology, we will not have the thinking skills and creative diversity for Hong Kong to compete globally."

The competition intends to encourage discussion and social responsibility on important issues in Hong Kong through photography. To extend this dialogue, a photo library will be set up online where the winning images (under a Creative Commons license) can be used for lectures, workshops, school talks and other non-commercial projects. They will also represent a photographic history of modern-day Hong Kong.\nSchools may choose one of the following three themes:\n- Poverty in Hong Kong\n- Beauty and Ugliness\n- Disappearing Wildlife\nTo enter the contest, participants can visit: www.openphotocontest.hk and register with their Facebook account. Each participant can upload a maximum of 10 photos. Each photo must have a title. The organisers of the Contest will pick out the finalists and the winners will be selected by public vote. The winner, first runner-up and second runner-up will receive HK$20,000, HK$10,000 and HK$5,000 respectively as well as competition trophies.\nWhat the judges are looking for: focused theme, creativity, technique, layout and potential for discussion.\nYour school wants to enter the HK Open Photo Contest.

But many believe their punishments don't always match the crime.\n\"Celebrities have a huge advantage over the average person,\" said Harvey Levin, managing editor of the entertainment news website TMZ.com. \"Juries are comprised of television watchers, moviegoers, people who listen to music, and they tend to show a lot of goodwill towards celebrities.\"\nHowever, many A-listers do have good records when it comes to bouncing back from a crime. Actress Winona Ryder was arrested on shoplifting charges and accused of stealing US$5,500 worth of designer clothes and accessories at a famous department store. In 2002, she was sentenced to 480 hours of community service, US$3,700 in fines, US$6,355 in repayment to the department store and ordered to attend psychological and drug counseling.\nTwo years later, a judge reduced her crimes to misdemeanors (lesser charges) after she completed her 480 hours of community service. She has since gone on to star in more than 20 films.\nAs members of the Liberal Studies Society,"

      "**Children should start school at six**\nPupils should not receive full classroom tuition until the age of six, according to a leading academic. Dr Richard House, senior lecturer at Roehampton University, said pupils, especially those from relatively well-off backgrounds, suffered the most from being pushed \"too far, too fast\". He said that students can benefit from being slowed down in the early years, allowing them to develop naturally.\nHe warned that if kids are pushed into formal schooling from a very young age, there is a higher chance for them to suffer lifelong negative health effects and even premature death. He added: \"Most children under the age of six need lots of time to play, and to develop social skills, and to learn to control their impulses. An over-emphasis on formal classroom instruction, staying in instead of playing outside, can have serious effects that might not surface until years later.\"\nThe conclusions follow a research study that found that starting late \"appears to have no adverse effect on children's progress\". Dr House, however, admitted that early schooling may be beneficial to children with poor family backgrounds. \"There are of course some children from very deprived backgrounds who in general would, and certainly do, gain a net benefit from starting school early,\" he said. \"But the evidence is now quite overwhelming that such an early introduction to formal schooling is quite unnecessary for the majority of children, and even worse, this can actually cause major developmental harm, and at worst a shortened life-span.\"\nYou are preparing for a debate with the motion \"Starting formal schooling before the age of six does more harm than good to children\"."

Having said that, dozens of people are bitten by venomous snakes every year. Common reasons for snake bite incidents include:\n- Walking through overgrown trails\n- Walking on a dimly lit trail and stepping on an unseen snake\n- Finding a snake and trying to kill it or pick it up\n- **Education, not fear**：Instead of fearing snakes, Sargent suggests that we should try to see them as part of the ecosystem just like any other creature. People need to learn more about them, he says, through online research and books or even speaking to people who have snakes as pets.\nSargent says, \"I take visitors out in the field to photograph snakes. I train them how to look for snakes and how to get the best photos. Very quickly the reaction goes from 'Arrgh!' to 'Wow, that's a fascinating creature, I didn't know that' and 'Can I go with you again?'\" So the next time you see a snake, remain calm, give it space, grab your camera and feel lucky that you have seen a fascinating creature that's just getting on with its day."

Common reasons for snake bite incidents include:\n- Walking through overgrown trails\n- Walking on a dimly lit trail and stepping on an unseen snake\n- Finding a snake and trying to kill it or pick it up\n- **Education, not fear**：Instead of fearing snakes, Sargent suggests that we should try to see them as part of the ecosystem just like any other creature. People need to learn more about them, he says, through online research and books or even speaking to people who have snakes as pets.\nSargent says, \"I take visitors out in the field to photograph snakes. I train them how to look for snakes and how to get the best photos. Very quickly the reaction goes from 'Arrgh!' to 'Wow, that's a fascinating creature, I didn't know that' and 'Can I go with you again?'\" So the next time you see a snake, remain calm, give it space, grab your camera and feel lucky that you have seen a fascinating creature that's just getting on with its day."

      "**Standing Desks**\nIt seems the world is finally realising that humans evolved to stand, not to sit. The evidence is mounting to show that spending too much time sitting at work, during your commute and for leisure increases your risk of several diseases and early death. Unfortunately for us, technological advances and design experts have made sitting more comfortable. Australian adults, for example, now sit for an average of nearly nine hours a day, which is longer than most people spend sleeping.\nSo, could it be time to buy a standing desk?\nMany people know when they've been sitting too long, because their back or neck gets sore. But it's what you can't feel or see that you may need to be concerned about. Canadian researcher, Dr Katzmarzyk, found that those who sit for long periods of time during the day have nearly a one-third higher risk of early death than those who stand a lot.\nOur message is to stand up, sit less and move more. Alternating between sitting and standing increases muscular movement, stimulates blood flow and results in more calories burnt and healthier blood sugar levels. Recent findings show that alternating between 30 minutes of sitting and standing can improve blood sugar levels, particularly after a meal.\n**A Standing Desk**\nNow, if you're thinking about getting a standing desk, but are concerned about your concentration and productivity, there's some good news. Research shows task performance such as typing, reading and performing cognitive tests is largely unaffected by standing desks."

But not far from the resorts that line the beach, hundreds of families live in hopeless poverty, their \"real world\" means trying to live on HKS4 a day.\nAn international school in Hong Kong took a group of 65 students to Cebu on a one week trip to work with disadvantaged people in the Philippines. The high school students, accompanied by 20 adults, each paid HKS5000 for the trip,which included flight, accommodation, transport and meals.\nThe first three days were spent sightseeing, snorkelling and other beach activities. The next four days were spent supporting local teachers in the classroom teaching English,maths and science. The students also helped in sustainable projects such as building houses, painting a school and serving nutritious food to children in slum communities.\nAfter the experience,one of the students said, \"T had a really great time in Cebu but it was sad to see people living in poverty.We were only there for a short time and I think we were helpful. But,I wonder if we really make a difference in the long term.\"\nOne of the teachers says visiting these communities in the Philippines enables Hong Kong students to see that they live very privileged lives.They also see that the children in the Philippines are similar to them, even though their circumstances are different."

It's among several nature-based schools that have emerged in the city,operating without classrooms or uniforms. While most kindergartens in Hong Kong adopt an academic approach, a few educators are promoting the power of outdoor play, exploration and nature during this critical period in a child's development. Smith's playschooll explores countryside destinations from Tai Tong Eco Park in Yuen Long to Lions Nature Education Centre in Sai Kung\n\"The children love it when they enter the forest, I am astonished every day at how creative and comfortable they are in nature. I call it the magic of play,\" says Smith, who supports unstructured play, which allows children to improvise and to learn how to interact with each other.\n\"The children might return from their outing, clothes dirty and tired out from the running around,but they'll be more confident and independent than they were in the morning,\" he says.\"At school,children are expected to follow rules, sit still and listen to teachers.

Tricksters make more than HKS85 million from these types of calls alone.\nThe widespread use of mobile devices for payment and harmful computer programs and phone apps account for the high success of such crimes. The tricksters will continue to apply the latest technology and invent new scenarios to exploit the victims' psychological weaknesses.\nTo guard against these traps, avoid clicking on any link that claims to carry bizarre information, such as pictures of former classmates or offers of a free iPhone. Do not trust anyone. Do not agree to any caller's instruction before you have established his/her identity. Hang up and call the respective organization to double-check."

Polite and softly spoken, the 27-year-old Hongkonger is modest about her win and says she has got much to learn. But beneath the playful smile- like the ones she gives her \"Bao\" characters -she has a fiery determination.She didn't prepare for the final of Secret Walls- in frontt of a live audience - preferring to freestyle.\n\"I was really angry that day -I was annoyed by something one of my clients said which was rude - so I made use of that emotion,\" says Ho.\nFortunately, most of the time Ho is a happy soul and her amusing paintings occupy some key wall space in Aberden, Central and Sheung Wan. One restaurant owner loved her work so much that he invited Ho to paint a mural outside his new cafe in Sheung Wan.\nHo has a very individual style. Her black and white murals are a striking graphic mix of human bodies, animals, flowers and patterns with the addition of perhaps one colour.Depending on the size,she charges HKS10,000 to HKS15,000 for one mural.\n\"A blank wall in a shop is so boring. A cool artwork is a talking point.It changes the feel of the space and makes it more relaxed and friendly,\" says Ho."

I know how she feels. I thought people are supposed to become independent in their 20s, but living at home largely prevents you from doing so.\nMy friends in the same situation often talk about how much they want independence, to be away from the watchful eyes of their families.It's not that we aren't allowed to do as we please, it's just that we can never feel completely comfortable. From small things, like being asked what time you'll be home, to what a friend describes as \"invisible powers dictating what you can and can't do\". At the end of the day, it all comes down to being careful of what I do out of respect for my elders.\nI wish I could make my family understand that staying out all night, not having meals at home and turning my room into a private sanctuary are not signs of disrespect to them. They are actions born out of a longing for my own space.\nZac, 24 yrs old"

Among the top complaints were taxi drivers refusing a hire, overcharging and not taking the most direct route.The traditional taxi industry has admitted it is failing to serve customers properly, as dissatisfied customers turn to alternative private car services such as Uber.\nSince 2003 when the Transport Complaints Unit started compiling figures on taxi services,the total number of complaints has topped 93,728. The true complaint figures are likely to be far higher. In 2014, complaints topped 10,060,accounting for almost 50 per cent of the unit's complaints across public transport services.\n\"Taxi driver misconduct has spread into many areas, which is why there. is public demand for online hire-car services like Uber,\" said Michael Tien, Legco's Transport panel chairman.\"If you think about what Uber is offering, it is directly focusing on these complaint areas.\"\nRefering to the increasingly bad reputation of taxi drivers, Eddie Wong Chung-keung, former chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, said:\"It'sa reality. We even complain about the taxi drivers ourselves.\"\nAs part of a unit on Hong Kong tourism in your English Language class, your group has been asked to discuss the image of Hong Kong taxi drivers and to suggest ways to improve this image.

As the city gets bigger and the boar population increases, these creatures appear to be spending more time out of the woods and causing panic on the streets.\nOn a Sunday in May, a wild boar got into the Paradise Mall in the city's Chai Wan district, walked into a children's clothing store and scared off the two shop assistants. The small female boar climbed up into, and then crashed through,the store's ceiling. Earlier in the day on the other side of town, another wild boar was captured in a public park after taking a swim in a lake.\nTwo opposing solutions have emerged about how to deal with this problem. The Sai Kung Wild Pig Hunting Club proposes, simply, to shoot the animals.\"They are wild animals and not pets\", says Chan Kang, the 72-year-old factory owner who leads the hunting club.\"Boars are fierce. They can weigh up to 200 kilos and can give birth up to three times a year.\" The Hong Kong Wild Boar Concern Group, meanwhile, argues that the creatures are cute. Its members hand out pamphlets that feature drawings of adorable, furry boars and they urge residents to keep calm when they meet a wild boar,not to call the police and to enjoy the \"special encounter."

Diners can enjoy the experience of a tailor-made menu or leave it up to the chef and be surprised.\nPrivate kichens, however, are not llicensed restaurants. They are more like private clubs and so the licensing requirements are not as strict as for regular restaurants.So, many private kitchens just cater to their own members and not the general public.Guests usually need to book well in advance and owners can't display menus in the window or promote themselves as public dining establishments. By operating a private kitchen instead of a restaurant,\"'you don't have to go through all the fod and safety requirements,\" Hui says.\"Whatt you do inside is up to you and the members.\"\nYou and your group are working on a project on dining experiences in Hong Kong.

A quality-control crackdown is well overdue.\nFew people would deny that people in need of food and a roof over their heads have the right to beg,but this should not extend into awful, never-ending karaoke. The stark truth is that you are much more likely to hear a busker destroying a classic pop song in Hong Kong than to hear something that might actually make your day any better. Such buskers should be fined on the spot.\nOne solution would be a public competition.Local celebrities could judge the musical talent and make jokes about the less talented buskers for our amusement.Winners, selected by viewers, could then be given a permit for the best 'musical locations in the city, and harmony would be restored."

These students reported that they text, watch television, and play video games for an average of four-and-a-half hours on a typical school day.\nAt the beginning of the study, students were evaluated for their ability to recognize other people's emotions in photos and videos. The students were shown 48 pictures of faces that were happy, sad, angry or scared, and asked to identify their feelings. They were divided into two groups and then, one group of students was sent to a camp for five days where they weren't allowed to use electronic devices.\nAfter five days, all students were asked to look at another set of photos. The children who had been at the camp improved significantly in their ability to read facial emotions and other nonverbal cues to emotion, compared with the students who continued to use their media devices.\n\"This research shows a model of what more face-to-face interaction can do,\" the researcher said.\"Empathy is our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion. When children grow up without the ability to empathize, they won't trust others or develop creativity.\""

      "HONG KONG EXAMINATIONS AND ASSESSMENT AUTHORITY HONIG KONG DIPLOMA OF SECONDARY EDUCATION EXAMINATION 2016\nENGLISH LANGUAGE PAPER 4\nPART A Group Interaction\nWalking in Hong Kong\nHong Kong's streets are like no other place in the world, and walking through the city's streets is part of what shapes us into such a unique community. Unlike the inhabitants of car-reliant North America, walking is a daily activity for us all. With one of the world's best public transport systems, we walk from home to the station or bus stop, we use our feet to shop, eat or simply wander, taking in the vibrant street life that surrounds us. We city-dwellers love it, and why not? It's carbon-neutral and it keeps us fit.\nIncreasingly, however, street-level crossings are being wiped out,and pedestrians are being directed to a succession of footbridges and underground tunnels.While Hong Kong is dense and some layering is necessary, these aerial networks keep us away from our own streets, and our own sense of community.\nLandscape architect Gavin Coates says,\"Since the 1950s everything has been completely car-oriented. The result today is an extremely unfriendly environment for pedestrians. London, New York, and Paris have all moved on...there has been a dramatic shift in terms of their thinking while Hong Kong seems stuck in the 1960s. Our city is for people, not for cars. The vehicles-first mentality seems absurd in Hong Kong where only about 6.67 percent of the population own a car.If the majority of the population doesn't own a car, why are drivers given such importance?"

The next time you and your friends take a group pic inside an MTR train,know that you've just enjoyed one of Hong Kong's wonderful liberties,because Singapore prohibits snapping photos on all trains.\n2. Forgot your towel after you've finished showering? You can make that trek across the living room naked if you choose. But in Singapore you would be breaking the law if in public view and could be fined up to SS2,000 (HKS11,245) and thrown in jail for three months.\n3. If you forget to flush a public toilet in Hong Kong, the worst punishment you'd get is a scolding.Over in Singapore,you'd be committing a crime and could be fined SS150.\n4. Littering is no excuse, but sometimes we can be forgetful with our rubbish. In Singapore,the first offence could be an instant fine of up to ss2,000, and with a third offence you may have to clean the streets while wearing a sign that says,\"'I am a literer\".\n5. Suffering from bad breath? Here,we can buy gum at any 7-11 for a quick fix. But in Singapore,you wouldn't be able to find any because selling gum is strictly forbidden.\nImagine the Hong Kong Government is proposing to introduce the five laws above in line with Singapore.In your group discuss this proposal.

Police helmets will be used as lampshades in the coffeee shops, with bowler hats as wall lights, while illuminated windows will reveal famous British views including Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament.\nPOLICS\nTeddy bear-themed coffeee shops are not new to major Chinese cities,but company founder Paul Jessup believes there is still a place in the market for an authentic British brand.\"More Chinese are learning to appreciate Western culture as they seek greater quality in their life.

I didn't know what to say. Sure, I'd heard of participation prizes, but I was expecting little pencils and erasers, not trophies that looked exactly like the ones the real winners got.\nThese days, even the term \"winner\" can get you into trouble, Today, it's al about finding their own space and how we're all 'winers\".,\nWhen I was a kid, I wasn't very good at sports and although it was painful to always be the last person to be picked for the team, I did learn something really valuable - how to lose. Losing builds character and toughness in a way that nothing else can.\nYet, fewer and fewer kids these days are learning this important lesson. According to a recent study by the Chance to Shine charity, most schoolchildren would be \"relieved or not bothered\" if competitive games were disallowed. Some schools in Singapore, for example, have started to ban some playground games, because they put too much pressure on some kids.\nI understand that losing is discouraging and that kids sometimes need to experience the excitement of winning in order to gain confidence, but I worry that, in our rush to protect our kids, we could be doing more harm than good.\nIn preparation for writing an essay, your group is discussing whether Hong Kong schools should treat all children as winners.

Meditation is a practice aimed at enhancing self-awareness and reducing anxiety by focusing, without judgment, on the present moment.\"Close your eyes and take three deep breaths,\"' she instructs her students,who fall into a familiar rhythm of silently counting their breaths.\nWith research linking meditation to improved focus, mood and behavior, the movement has ballooned, spreading from health-care institutions to well-known companies, the military and athletics. Now, it's increasingly being used at schools and with children.\nWith high-stakes tests beginning in elementary schooll, increasingly overscheduled afternoons and pressure to do more demanding extracurricular activities at ever-younger ages, kids are feeling overwhelmed. Supporters of meditation hope the practice can help them cope with the demands.\nThe idea of getting restless kids to sit still in one place might seem difficult, but they enjoy it, readily tuming to the practice as a way to self-soothe, and taking the techniques home with them.\n\"When I'm mad, and I get into a fight with my brother or anyone in my family, Igo up to my room, and I start meditation, and it calms me down so things get back to normal,\" says Jacopo Cascone, one of Ryden's fourth-grude students.,\"I thought it was weird at first,\" he says,\"but now I realise it totally helps with everything in my life.\""

      "HONG KONG EXAMINATIONS AND ASSESSMENT AUTHORITY HONG KONG DIPLOMA OF SECONDARY EDUCATION EXAMINATION 2016\nENGLISH LANGUAGE PAPER 4\nPART A Group Interaction\nTwin-credible! Secondary school with 20 sets of twins\nDe Aston School, a secondary school in Lincolnshire, England, has a record-breaking number of twins i attendance. Among the 907 pupils enrolled at the school, there are 20 pairs of twins, 12 of whom are identical. Most incredibly, the school welcomed six sets of identical twins this past September, all of whom started grude seven.\nStunned teachers at the school say they have never seen anything like it and believe there must have been \"something in the water\" in the local area.\nSince the school requires students to dress in identical blue and white uniforms, it's proven difficult for the teachers to tell the siblings apart. Most of the twins have also found it confusing, with their classmates and teachers having trouble telling them apart. Kieron and Calvin Chow, 14, both say they are often mistaken for one another, even by their teachers, and Charlotte and Stephanie Rae, 14, say they would like to be treated more as individuals in day-to-day life.\nWhether it's 15-year-old Nicole and Macy Yuen, who say they answer the same questions with the same answers at the same time, or 11-year-old Charlotte Kaur, who came down with a headache after her identical twin Emily banged her head, there really is a touch of twin magic in De Aston's classrooms.\nEllenor Beighton, De Aston Schoo's headteacher, said:\"All f our twins are delightful young people who we treat as individuals and we're very happy to have them here.\""

      "HONG KONG EXAMINATIONS AND ASSESSMENT AUTHORITY HONG KONG DIPLOMA OF SECONDARY EDUCATION EXAMINATION 2016 ENGLISH LANGUAGE PAPER 4\nPART A Group Interaction\nYoung people are drinking less so they don't look bad on Facebook\nA new study in the UK has found that people aged 16-24 are drinking significantly less alcohol, with 27% giving up alcohol, almost a 10% increase from 10 years ago.At the same time, young people binge-drinking (drinking a lot at once) has fallen to18%.Interestingly, the changes in young people's drinking don't seem to be because of health reasons. A concern much more important than liver damage? Facebook embarrassment.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), young people are scared of being shamed on social media with drunk photos and Twitterr evidence of their embarrassing behaviour. The ONS says \"Young people who spend a lot of time online are quite happy to tag photos of their friends who are drunk and passed out on the floor, but are more concerned about being tagged themselves. This might curb their behaviour.\"\nThe convenience of sharing photos with friends (and non-friends) through social networking sites and blogs is undeniable. People forget however that anything posted on Facebook or anywhere else on social media can come back to haunt them in the future. Even if a person deletes a photo, it will continue to live on if another person has shared it. In addition, tagging, or identifying people on social media pictures, poses dangers such as revealing a person's name, what they look like, and their location when the picture was uploaded."

It's an interesting experimental project that aims to help people do something better than fiddling with their mini gadgets while they are waiting. It also hopes to bring back the culture of reading literature that is lost in a technological world\nThe short story vending machines deliver good quality popular literature to people waiting in public spaces, just like the way soft drinks are dispensed. The original stories have been written by established authors from the community and also by new authors who want to publish their work.However,the best part about these vending machines is they are free to use. In all, there will be eight machines spread across the town: at the town hall,the tourist office, libraries and in social centres.\nUsers have the option to choose the length of the literature depending on the time they have to kill The 'three minute' format,for example, takes the form of a piece of paper that's 8 X 60 cm in size,while the 'five minute' version could be double the size.\nSo the next time you have to wait for your friend to arrive,you will have enough stories to tell when you meet."

It was first and foremost a design project, inspired by the massive number of kids walking around with their faces buried in their iPhones.\n\"You have 18-24 year olds walking down the hall with smartphones, you're almost bound to run into someone somewhere; it's something we're dealing with in this day and age,\" the Principal said.\"Preventing accidents isn't the reason we did it-we did it to engage the students, It's meant to be there for people to look at and enjoy.\"\nNational Geographic Museum drew similar lanes along a stretch of street in Washington D.C.It was an experiment for a TV series on behavioural science called \"Mind over Masses.\" However, this caused confusion in the city because some people followed the lanes while others just ignored them.\nWill these walking lanes have much of an impact? Considering that those who text and walk probably don't pay much attention to their surroundings in the first place, it's likely they won't even notice the change. Regardless, these texting lanes have sparked conversation about distracted walking, and that's always a good start in pointing out a major societal problem."

Shenzhen's Qianhai economic zone may be the solution but you'd better be prepared to live without Facebook or Twitter.\nHerman Leung Ka-hin, who is from Hong Kong, is now working for a finance company in Shenzhen. Leung graduated this year and made the decision to work on the Mainland during his final year of study.\n\"I believe in the prospect of mainland China economic growth,\" he said. \"It would be better for me to start my career in the Mainland.\"\nUnlike jobs in Hong Kong with well-established career paths, Leung said his boss told him to expect uncertainty in his job because there were new policies and new developments all the time.\nLeung said that would give him more opportunities to try something new.\n\"Before I came here, I worried about working with mainland colleagues as there might be cultural differences,\" he said. \"But after working here, I found that I had been over-worrying and I work with my mainland colleagues well.\"\nLeung said pay levels in Qianhai were similar to Hong Kong but the cost of living was much lower.\nOne thing he would like to see improve is the traffic, He lives in an apartment in northern Shenzhen provided by his employer and has to spend more than an hour travelling to or from Qianhai due to traffic jams.\nHongkongers working in Qianhai also miss out on some popular social media network such as Facebook and Twitter, which are banned on the Mainland along with some overseas websites."

I have no problem with it, even though we have a young family just starting out, with all the expenses that go along with that stage in life and having a baby.\nI do understand why we do it. It's a respect thing. It's a way to show honour to parents, and with my husband's parents it isn't really about the money or even the amount, it's about the act itself. This is an important way that Chinese parents can express or accept love from their children and it also seems to be an easy way for Chinese families to show and accept love.\nThankfully my parents-in-law are not demanding in their attitude, but we like to give them some money anyway. We give it with a cheerful heart and see it as a blessing to show our love to them in this way. Also, this sort of thing is connected indirectly with the traditions of showing respect for elders, and remembering dead relatives and ancestor worship.\nHowever, I do know people who are in the same position as me, but don't have much money and find it very difficult to give money to older family members. They want to buy a flat or save money, but need to give money to their parents and parents-in-law. Sometimes their parents really need the money, so they have to give up their own hopes to help their family.\nIt's difficult."

The theme will focus on the works of various Hong Kong novelists in the genre and help promote Kung Fu themed books and stories.\nThe fair, which last year attracted more than a million people, runs from July 20 to 26 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.\nBenjamin Chau Kai-leung, from the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, noted that the fair has previously paid tribute to one author, but this year they have decided on a special theme for a change.\nAs part of the theme, a Chinese martial arts literature exhibition will feature in the art gallery with works from martial arts novelists topped by Louis Cha Leung-yung, better known as Jin Yong and eight other authors.\nPrized exhibits such as handwritten clips, first editions, screenplay adaptations and comic books from the novelists will also feature.\nChau pointed out that the work of these writers is becoming more popular around the world, \"The martial arts world portrayed in these novels embodies the essence of Chinese culture and is an important way of sharing and promoting Chinese culture. People all round the world are interested in Chinese Kung Fu,\" he said. \"Having a theme makes the fair distinct from previous years, builds excitement, increases awareness of our event and makes this year's fair feel fresher.\"\nTickets are HK$25 for adults and HK$10 for children and are available online and at convenience stores."

      "People who live and work in Hong Kong often struggle if they cannot speak Cantonese. It can be simple everyday problems like speaking to a taxi driver or getting served in a restaurant. As a result, recently more and more people are studying Cantonese. Total enrollment for Cantonese programmes grew by about 30% from 1,508 in 2010 to 1,918 last year at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Other institutions also report this trend.\nTypical of the increasing number of people studying Cantonese is Jonathan Ma, a 33-year-old English teacher, who was born in Hong Kong but moved to the United Kingdom when he was a child so he never learnt Cantonese. Ma recently began learning Cantonese intensively and he now realises how important it is not just for day-to-day living but also for understanding Hong Kong culture.\nWhile Hong Kong is a city where many people speak English or Putonghua, Cantonese dominates the local language scene and those who are not proficient in Cantonese can feel isolated from local culture, and find it difficult to establish relationships with the many locals who cannot speak the language that they do.\nNot having Cantonese limits not only their social circle but also their ability to understand issues that are important to Hongkongers and to integrate themselves into local communities."

      "Chances are if you've spent any time on social media in the past couple of years, you will have seen people throw a bucket of ice water over their heads to raise awareness for people who suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). If you have, you've taken part in a viral online campaign for a good cause.\nHere's how the Ice Bucket Challenge works: someone who wants to participate (or has been \"challenged\" via social media by a friend) films themselves dumping a bucket of ice water on their head. This person then challenges a friend to do the same in the name of ALS, within 24 hours, and/or donate money to the cause.\n\"People want to do something for the world. They want to contribute, but they want it to be easy,\" said Christine Outram, a charity representative. \"It's great because you have something that makes you feel good but isn't too hard to accomplish.\"\nThe viral challenge actually started when Pete Frates, a 29-year-old American resident diagnosed with ALS, had a bucket of water thrown over his head and he started posting pictures of the challenge on social media with his father's help. The pictures quickly went viral and spread across the internet.\n\"It is certainly amazing to see how far and wide the campaign continues to spread, increasing both awareness and funds,\" said Christine. \"Since the start of the challenge, there have been more than 307,600 posts on Twitter and public Facebook pages.\""

      "The Hong Kong Observatory was founded in 1883. Back then, it had a number of roles but the most important was providing accurate weather observations and a typhoon warning service. For shipping, which played a central role in the city's development, these warnings were vital.\nIn the more than a century since its establishment, the agency has evolved due to the changing expectations in the city and so has the number of weather warnings. There are now 21 weather warning signals. During the summer months it is common for warnings to be issued every day of the month and sometimes multiple warnings are issued at the same time.\nHowever, referring to the number of signals now used, Marco Wong Tse-yan, a senior manager for a local fast-food chain, said: \"The signals are confusing and not appropriate for modern international businesses; many shops don't even close now for some typhoon signal number eights because the weather might not be too bad.\" As Hong Kong has become more developed, the effect of the weather on daily life has reduced and not only are businesses questioning the use of signals but some schools also feel they are closing unnecessarily.\nAn Observatory spokeswoman, answering complaints about the effect warnings have on economic activities, said they make decisions purely on the basis of scientific data, rather than taking into account the impact a No.8 signal would have on businesses."

      "What is the difference between Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and Emotional Quotient (EQ)?\nIQ is a measure of people's intelligence.\nEQ is a measure of the ability of people to understand their own or other people's emotions and feelings.\nWhy is EQ important?\nEmotional intelligence is claimed to be more important than traditional measures of intelligence such as IQ Research shows that 85 percent of your financial success is due to EQ skills, your personality and ability to communicate, discuss, and lead. Surprisingly, only 15 percent is due to subject knowledge.\nWhy is low EQ a problem?\nMany kids today are \"emotionally unprepared\" to compete in the work environment because of low EQ. Low EQ is linked to violence, drinking alcohol, drug use, obesity and unhappiness.\nA survey found that more than half of American students experienced feelings of worry and anxiety, and about a third felt deep depression during the academic year. People with low EQ find it difficult to learn if they do not have the skills to handle their emotions and they don't feel safe and supported enough to talk to people around them.\nWhy might EQ be falling?\nChildren develop social and emotional skills through strong family and community links, as well as through free play with other children. But just as parents have become more protective and family size has fallen, then children's free time and face-to-face contact with others have also decreased."

      "Hongkongers have been borrowing fewer books from public libraries over the past five years, from over 60 million books in 2012 to 55 million this year - with smartphones being blamed for the fall.\nThe city's education system was also criticised for not developing a love of reading among students. And one cultural commentator said many of the readers visiting libraries were there for the air conditioning or to kill time.\nJimmy Pang Chi-ming, head of publishing house Subculture, said the reading culture in Hong Kong had been bad for years. \"Nowadays, Hong Kong people just surf the internet with their phones or tablets whenever they're free,\" Pang said. \"Fewer people read books so there are also fewer new books being published. It's a vicious circle.\"\nThat seems to be borne out by the statistics, which showed that the most borrowed English-language adult non-fiction book last year was an old English exam question paper. It was borrowed 9,124 times.\nIn contrast, according to the department's statistics, the number of times the public libraries' seven ebook collections were used rose from about 142,000 in 2012 to 194,000 times last year.",

      "Following the death of a 2-year-old man on Sunday during a fight between Leisure and Culture Services Department (LCSD) officials and performers, the Tuen Mun District Council held a meeting to look for more venues for the elderly to enjoy outdoor music performances.\nLarge crowds of retired people gather at Tuen Mun Park for free musical performances, especially on Saturdays and Sundays. The crowds enjoy singing and dancing to the music. Some performers use electronic music and amplifiers in the park, which is against regulations.\nThe LCSD received 400 noise complaints from last November to February. The number of complaints dropped to five from February to May after the department strictly enforced the ban on electronic music and amplifiers. However, enforcing the ban has caused trouble between performers and officials. Singing groups complained that singing without amplification was similar to \"cooking without salt\".\nTuen Mun district councillor Chan Wan-sang said the department planned to install a HK$50 million soundproof system in the park's theatre, and allow the use of amplifiers in one area, with noise not exceeding 70 decibels.\nMr Chan urged the department to open up more venues for the elderly people to perform music, saying one area will not be enough. Chan said unused squash courts and community centres should be provided for the elderly free-of-charge to ease the problem."

      "For nearly three years, Damo Miyawaki didn't talk to his family and friends. He seldom left his bedroom, sleeping during the day and staying up all night, surfing the web and reading Japanese comics. The only time he ever went outside was to eat, something he would do in the middle of the night to avoid any contact with other people.\nDamo, now 18, was suffering from a serious health and social condition that is facing many young people in many countries. It causes young people to stay indoors, sometimes for years, watching TV, surfing the internet and reading, avoiding all social contact and often cutting off ties with family and friends. In Japan, around one million people, mostly men between the ages of 15 and 20, are said to suffer from the condition.\nThis problem is very painful and serious for families, who are unable to communicate with sufferers and face daily problems arising from the condition. Some children refuse to speak to their parents and just wait for food to be placed outside their bedroom door.\nIt can also affect the economy, with those suffering not working or earning money.\nA specialist in this illness, Dr Kato states that, \"Much work and social life is now carried out remotely, using technology, and this causes problems but there are also cultural reasons such as a sense of embarrassment and an emotional dependence on the mothers. Often sufferers just feel that there are too many social pressures on them and they decide to withdraw from society.\""

      "Here's my prediction for the next growth industry: boot camps for children.\nThey are very popular with Korean parents, who send their kids off to these army-style boot camps where youngsters are shouted at, made to do difficult exercise, clean toilets, and sleep in basic conditions that shock many of the kids sent there. Parents send them because they are worried that the modern generation is too soft and spoiled.\nResearch has found that over-protective parenting occurs more frequently in educated and professional households, and that richer children complain more and are less self-sufficient. The recent story of maids going to university halls to clean rooms for Hong Kong students speaks for itself and would seem to corroborate the claim that many Hong Kong students are overprotected and lack independence.\nBoot camp forces children to face a difficult and challenging environment on their own in the hope that it will build those skills that the modern generation are often lacking. After two weeks cleaning toilets, eating basic food and running up mountains, parents hope their kids will better deal with managing disappointment.\nI've been threatening my daughter with a Korean style boot camp for years, ever since the time we stayed in the Peninsula Hotel, and she argued that the Venetian Macau was preferable. She knows this threat is empty, but honestly, if there were boot camps in Hong Kong, I'd be the first customer."

      "Apple may be the leading provider of smartphones in China but they announced that they sold 16% fewer iPhones in April 2016 than in April 2015 and made 18% less money from them.\nThe company said most of the fall was because the Chinese economy was not growing as fast as in the past China is the second-largest market in the world for Apple products behind the US, and profits in China fell 30%.\nIn addition to the weak economy, demand for iPhones was also hit by changing fashions. The iPhone is no longer seen as a must have for fashionable young people in China. Asian rivals, which are often cheaper, are now given more equal status.\nResearcher Annette Zimmerman wrote last month that the problem was not Apple's alone; pointing out that the price of smartphones in China was still the main problem, even for very inexpensive devices. The majority of Chinese people still cannot afford the price of a smartphone. \"Sellers were not able to reduce the price of a 'good enough to use' smartphone lower than US$50,\" she said.\nDespite the sales decrease, Tim Cook, Apple CEO said \"the future of Apple in China is very bright\" and promised that the company has some \"amazing innovations\" for the future."

      "Hong Kong needs more people to give blood, and finding new blood donors is a central aim of the Hong Kong Red Cross.\nThe Hong Kong Red Cross supplies blood to all Hong Kong hospitals and these supplies of blood are vital for the effectiveness of Hong Kong's health services.\nThe Red Cross is always looking for new donors, but finding enough people to give blood is difficult.\nFortunately, schools and young people are willing to give blood, with over 70% of new blood donors coming from secondary school students. Currently, students over the age of 16 can give blood, with their parents' permission.\nChan Kin-hei, a representative of the Red Cross, said, \"We are happy to go to schools at any time, but the schools should make sure that students have enough time to give blood, encourage them to take part by advertising our visit, and arrange for helpers to support our staff.\nChan stated that an important benefit of encouraging students to give blood is that once they give blood, many will continue to do so into their adult life. So not only is it important for the present needs of hospitals, but it is also good for long-term blood supplies.\nHe added that there were also health benefits for those who give blood: \"It's good for the heart, reduces the risk of cancer, and also students get a free blood test to check if they have any health problems.\""

      "I am writing to ask why there are so few bus lanes in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a small city and there are limits to the number of roads and lanes we have.\nThere is only 22 km of road reserved for buses, yet nearly 40% of people travel to work and school by bus.\nThe heavy traffic means that bus travel is slow, which increases the amount of pollution at our roadsides. Many people avoid using buses because they are so slow.\nI believe the government should urgently create bus priority lanes. They should also consider introducing extra bus lanes during peak hours.\nAlternatively they could ask private car owners to pay tolls or apply for a permit to use certain roads.\nSomething needs to be done to decrease bus journey times and make bus travel more convenient.\nJohn Wong, Kwun Tong",
      "More Congestion and Pollution\nIf we introduced bus lanes, it would lead to even worse pollution. There would be less space for cars so there would be more traffic jams than now.\nThis would be unfair to people who drive private cars. Many people have to drive private cars for their work. They would have a lot of inconvenience. Taxis, lorries and other road users would also suffer.\nHong Kong is just not a place where you can introduce more bus lanes.\nPeter Li, Wan Chai"

      "In a recent report, the incoming head of the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC), Hong Kong's anti-discrimination office, Alfred Chan Cheung-ming, is quoted as saying that one of his priorities will be to battle against age discrimination.\nI hope this will happen as although in the past the EOC has been active in other anti-discriminatory fields, I feel it has not done enough about the problem of discrimination faced by older people.\nI wish Mr Chan success in his fight to stop unequal treatment of the elderly, which is one of the most serious forms of discrimination that exists in Hong Kong. I say this because I think it may affect more people in a more truly negative way than any other form of discrimination.\nThe fact that so many people are forced to leave their employment only because of their age is a terrible aspect of Hong Kong life. In many countries this is no longer the case and there is no reason why Hong Kong should be behind other countries in this area.\nMr Chan's objective to increase work opportunities for senior citizens is an excellent one.\nI hope he can pressure the government to pass laws so that people of 60 and above, and sometimes even less than that, can continue in jobs that they are perfectly capable of doing, as well as more easily find jobs related to their expertise and experience.

Thank you John for taking me there and making sure I had the torch charged, for letting us know the weather information and for finding the route. The best thing you did was go first and check there were no spiders on the path! Thank you!!\n4 hours' hike with a big backpack, I was tired!! We arrived around 3am, put up the tent and said goodnight at around 4.30. But we didn't manage to see sunrise because we didn't get up until !!! Then we started our super relaxing morning, first came a cup of hot coffee, followed by hot noodles with a can of spicy pork.....m...yummy and feeling contented!!!\nWe then packed and started heading down at around midday. Omg, going down is far more challenging than going up, my legs were shaking during the last 20 minutes of the hike and immediately sat down on a bench when I saw one!\nFeeling tired today but it's all worth it, Only problem is there is no photo taking at night!! LD I was a bit nervous before the hike, thinking I am too slow and will drag the group down. John had assured me that I could walk at a slow pace. But I needn't have worried. We all helped each other.\nI slept for 14 hours after the hike!! Really a great night and day!!!"

      "The Hong Kong Government is looking at giving elderly people who live alone in public housing up to HKS8,000 a month to employ domestic helpers from overseas to look after them and help reduce the costs of providing care homes for the elderly.\nThe idea seems simple, and could be done by expanding the current community care servic voucher for the elderly. But unfortunately, it isn't that easy.\nFor the elderly, receiving the subsidy would only mark the beginning of a long list of hassles they would find difficult to handle, unless the government was committed to help them every step of the way. That would include assisting them in the hiring of a helper and paying regular visits - and I mean weekly, not once every few months - to ensure everything is going smoothly\nAnd when two adults stay together, sharing an extremely small public housing unit designed for use by one,won't problems arise over time due to the crowded space?\nThe results could be deadly if the relationship between the elderly person and helper goes terribly wrong.\nA sensible alternative is for those who have no family support and are unable to live independently to reside in dedicated homes for the elderly.\nInstead of investing in the subsidies, wouldn't it make better sense to use the money to improve existing facilities or build new ones, and employ staff trained to look after the residents 24 hours a day, seven days a week?"

      "TVB, Hong Kong's biggest free TV station, used to be Hong Kong's pride. It was a leader in shaping the city's pop culture in the 1980s. But the broadcaster appears to be losing support with the latest viewing figures showing that the average evening audience of TVB fell from 2.4 million in 1984 to 1.58 million in 2016.\nThe fall is especialy noticable in TVB top drama series. In 2008,four out of the five top-rated TVB shows had an average audience size of more than two milin viewers. By 2016, none of the five top-rated shows passed two million viewers.\nThe lack of financial investment and creativity are two reasons often given for the decline in the broadcaster's viewing figures. Many of the TVB drama serials have been shot using the same props and sceneries for years now.TVB fans have made fun of this by doing a \"screen capture\" of one scene in a drama series and comparing it with another done for another show. Because of the management's cost-control measures, only a small number of artists dominate the shows in primetime slots. As a result, viewers get confused after watching the same actor performing the roles of three different characters in three different drama programmes in a single night.\nThe worst may yet be to come for TVB though, as more Hong Kong viewers take to the intermet to satisfy their drama-watching craving,especially given the curent trend for watching al things Korean."

      "Teachers must have the right to switch off\nI am writing because I am concemed about the use of text messaging at schools in Hong Kong or to be precise the use of text messaging after school hours.\nMany schools in Hong Kong now allow teachers and students to communicate with each other by tex message. This is so much easier now for students, with the numerous instant messaging tools available on smartphones. It can significantly improve real-time communication when in the past a delay was inevitable.\nSome schools even create Whats App groups for each class. These include the teacher,the students and critically they often include the parents.\nAs a result, many teachers nowadays are concemed about the number of text messages they get from parents after the school day has ended and they are back at home\nMany teachers feel they have to answer the guestions that have been posed, often related to schoolwork. f they cannot give a swift reply then the students or their parents might blame them for being inefficient and not professionally-conscientious. If they do reply they are accused of being biased or favouring one particular student.\nStudents and parents need to appreciate that teachers have the right to enjoy their leisure time. In my opinion, teachers should be authorised to decline to reply to such questions after school hours if they want to.\nSamuel Lee, Sai Kung"

The service works by allowing cyclists to rent and drop of bicycles around Hong Kong.\n\"We are here to make transportation convenient and affordable,\"' he said. A ride on a Smart bike will cost HKSS per half hour. Currently, bike rentals for leisure purposes cost HKS40 per day in Tai Po.\nWong said that there was a great demand for bike-sharing in a city like Hong Kong, where people walk considerable distances between public transport stops. Bicycles certainly fill this gap.\nTo rent a Smart bike, which is powered by solar panels, users will ned to log into a mobile application, register their credit card and pay a deposit of HKS399. An active map will locate the nearest bicycle.\nThe company has 400 bikes at present. The number is expected to reach 1,00 y the end of the week, and 20,000 by July.\nUnlike existing bike rental services in Hong Kong, cyclists riding Smart bikes will not have to pick up and drop off their bicycles at fixed locations.\n\"You can park them anywhere as long as it is legal,\" Wong said, referring to public cycle parking spaces across the city.\nHe said the service could also be a solution for people who had very limited iving space to store their own bikes."

They all have to wear the same tshirts and do a sequence of crazy activities.\nEvery OCamp has a \"city hunt\"- where students are given silly tasks to do all over the city. You might be sent to Fortress to ask for a solar-powered flashlight - an old joke from a Stephen Chow movie - or be told to wave at people in the gym until they wave back.\nThen there's the \"Campfire\", Sometimes there's a circle of flashlights,sometimes there's not,but the whole group joins in and is taught songs and dances.\nStudents stay up talking, getting to know each other. They have to learn as much as they can about each other before the start of university.\nIt's frankly crazy, but it works. OCamp is about bringing different students together and giving them a way to bond, starting them out on friendships that will get them through university and beyond.

My solution? Sitting doing nothing.Taking time to do nothing and letting yourself pause from friends and technology is one of the best things you can do. Here are four reasons to simply do nothing.\n1. It Stops Tech Addiction.\nSmarphone addiction is a real thing. Spending too much time using technology and social media has been linked to depression and worry, and poor sleep. So the next time you have time to kill, stick your phone in your bag and kill time the old-fashioned way: whether it's daydreaming, doodling, or just sitting around, keep away from that screen.\n2.Doing Nothing Can Boost Creativity.\nResearch has found that daydreaming involves the same process that goverm imagination. So if you're looking to get more creative, do nothing and let the creative juices flow.\n3. You Can Discover New Hobbies & Interests\nIf you use the extra energy you have saved doing nothing to try a new activity, you'll enjoy your time and learn something,whereas if you're just scrolling through Instagram, you won't really have gained anything.\n4.Unplgging & Recharging Can Relieve Stress.\nTake some time to unplug and recharge for improved slep and lessress."

      "I was glad to see that the three-day e-sports festival in Mongkok last weekend proved to be so popular, with gamers coming from all over the world to take part,If you're not up to speed, an e-sports festival is an event where gamers compete by playing multi-player video games on a huge screen on stage with a live audience watching.\nThe event in Mongkok was the first event of its kind in Hong Kong though big c-sports festivals in South Korea have been attracting large numbers of tourists and spectators to their venues in recent years. Many Hong Kong locals took the opportunity to attend hoping to learn something from the top international players.\nThe government gave a grant of HKS35 million for the festival and, as it was so successful, I hope additional funding will be made available so that we can see more of these events involving gamers from here and abroad.\nA word of warning though for all of you who have set your hearts on having a career as a professional gamer touring the world competing at these events. Just like being a pop star,only a lucky few succeed. Many more fall by the wayside, their dreams in tatters with nothing more than a video game addiction to show for it, while their classmates at school have passed their exams and moved on to university.\nTheo Lam, Po Lam"

Then recruits are assigned to fire stations around Hong Kong to begin a three-year probation period.\"On-the-job field training is very important because this is where recruits are dealing with real-life scenarios,\" says Wong. The FSD also provides public education and awareness training and carries out fire safety inspections on licensed premises."

I also don't see any new composers trying to do anything innovative. People seem content to just turmn out the same old formulae again and again.\nWhat do you think about our upcoming artists?\nThe talent is higher but the motivation is lower, which is a pity. Artists these days aren't hungry enough. They just want to do music because it's fun and cool\nWhy do you feel young people aren't hungry enough?\nI think these days lifeis too easy for them. They get everything they want from their parents. They ofen have helpers and grandparents carrying bags and doing everything for them.\nDo you think we can change this?\nIt will be very difficut. The schools are not strict enough and so students don't learn the importance of hard work. Stars like Jacky Chan spent years and years working hard every day to develop their talent. Now young people think it is enough to have a cool haircut and the latest fashions.\nWhat advice would you give to young people wanting to join the musie scene?\nThey need to put down their phones and realise that if they have talent it needs to be developed and the only way to do that is hard work and practice."

They don't have enough time to spend with their families and are so tired that on Sundays they often sleep all day.\nLife in the city is too hectic, and the workplace is too competitive.\nHowever, the pace of life is much slower in Taiwan.I think you can enjoy a much less complicated way of life there and being away from the fierce competition in Hong Kong's offices must be very liberating.\nFamilies with children can have a good quality of life because, although the salaries are lower in Taiwan, the cost of living is also much lower.\nWhile it is a big change in lifestyle, I am sure people who relocate to Taiwan will eventually adapt to living there and enjoy living there.\nLily Wong,Kwai Chung"

      "I support the Hong Kong Baptist University's (HKBU) recent decision to relax attendance requirements for all its students. In the past,students skipping more than 30 per cent of classes would fail a course automatically. Under the new policy, they can still pass with less-than-perfect attendance records.\nI feel this new policy may improve the overall quality of teaching and stimulate innovation among teaching staff at the university.\nUniversity students are young adults who should learn to make responsible decisions on how to spend their time. If they find a better way to study course materials than attending lectures,the university should respect their choices.\nAlso,unde the new policy, all university teachers must rethink how to attract students with more effective teaching, as their attendance is no longer guaranteed.\nAs a lecturer at the university myself, I have created a series of video lectures students will watch in advance. They can learn the basic concepts and techniques at their own pace through the videos and assigned reading.They can then discuss the materials and receive my feedback on their thinking during class. I have also created Whats App groups for my students to discuss course materials outside the classrooms.\nWith the new attendance policy, Baptist University is well positioned to provide more resources allowing students to access course materials in videos,to study anywhere using their mobile devices and to juggle different commitments in more flexible schedules.\nSimon Wang,Kowloon Tong"

      "The appearance of nine-year-old Hong Kong singer Celine Tam on US talent show America's Got Talent has reignited a debate on parenting, with some members of the public accusing her parents of not letting her have a childhood\nOther bloggers have defended her parents,howover, claiming that her parents are only helping Celine achieve her dreams.\nTam's audition - in which she sang the hit My Heart Will Go On - went viral with over 7 milion views. Local media reported that she began learning to sing when she was three years old. She practises for several hours a day, and has participated in numerous televised Hong Kong and mainland Chinese talent shows in her nine short years.\nBut Tam's story sparked comments from some Hongkongers,\"This is outrageous,\" wrote one commenter on the Facebook page of news outlet Apple Daily.\"Just another way for her parents to make money off her.\"\nAnother agreed:\"Why couldn't they have waited until she's lder and more mature before pushing her out in front of everyone?\"\nOthers disagreed, however, claiming that Tam's experience was not extraordinary.\"Many children have entered similar competitions. As a parent, if you don't make a decision for your kids, people will say you're irresponsible,\" wrote ManInCentral-CK.\"But if you make a decision for them, people will say you don't respect their wishes.\""

      "In recent weeks a number of mainland Chinese secondary schools have introduced new nules designed to discourage teenage dating and romance. Many people are unhappy about the new rules.\nIn one secondary school in Hangzhou, pupils of the opposite sex have been given a very important new instruction. They must maintain a minimum distance of half a metre from each other at all times. In addition, boys and girls are not allowed to go around school premises in pairs.\nAnother school, in the eastern city of Wenzhou,Zhejiang province,has banned what it calls \"close interaction\" between students of the opposite sex as well as students of the same sex. They do not define what \"close interaction\" really means.\nThe school authoritis in Wenzhou have threatened \"severe punishment\" against offenders.\nSecondary schools in China admit students aged just 11 - they are just at the point when they become interested in the opposite sex.\nAnd with reports that teenage romance has become more popular at schools, school authorities -as well as parents- are worried that children's academic performance is being affected.\nSome schools have moved to stop the young love with the implementation of tight measures - and they will certainly find support from some.\nMany Chinese regard teenage romance as something undesirable -a feeling that \"early love\" is immature love -and this helps explain why schools are increasingly teaching young people about the \"undesirable cffects\" of dating."

      "To reduce stress,sink into a sound bath (no water required) Gong baths are a type of music therapy that have been used for healing for thousands of years. Canadian-bomn Martha Collard wants to help as many people as possible to lower stress in fast-paced Hong Kong.To do this, she set up Red Doors Studio, where she hosts gong baths.We gave it a try.\nWhat is a gong bath? Don't be confused by the word bath - there is no water.It's the sound waves that you are bathed in. Healing with harmonious sound, such as singing or drumming has been used to clear minds and bodies for thousands of years and gongs (basically flat metal drums) are ideal for this.\nHow does it work? Taking a gong bath is easy. You don't have to do anything except lie down and close your eyes.,Get under the comfortable blanket, have a lavender-scented eye pillow placed over your eyes and .. gong.\nHow does it feel?\nThe emotional effect was instant: I had tears in my eyes and the hairs on my arms stood up.Collard says everyone's reaction is different.\"Some people laugh, some cry.\" Immediately after the session I felt \"fuzzy\", as if in a dreamlike state but a few hours later I had intense focus and energy: I was \"buzzing\" so much that I found it difficult to sleep, something that never normally happens.\nDecision I will definitely make it a regular thing."

      "Earlier this year, the University of Hong Kong banned the sale of disposable bottled water on its Pok Fu Lam campus. This green initiative was welcomed.\nNow, in this new academic year, one department at HKU has implemented an unprecented policy - a ban on giving printed paper handouts to students.\nI believe this is the right thing to do, and the initiative should be adopted by other departments and the other universities in Hong Kong as well.\nA semester at our universities asts about three months, so students will use any handouts that they are given for a very short period of time only. After the term ends, they will probably not be read again.\nSometimes, lecturers even print out in-class activity materials that are only used for a few minutes. This is such a tremendous waste of paper.\nNearly all university students these days own laptops. These can be used to access online learning resources systems (in HKU and most of the other universities, it is called Moodle) onto which lecturers will upload teaching materials. As long as teachers upload their handouts, there is no need for printouts.\nThis can significantly reduce the amount of paper used for eaching purposes. It is through this kind of cooperation that we can ensure the sustainability of our world.\nAnson C.Y.Chan, North Point"

With limited life experience and an eagerness to seek jobs, students ofen fall prey to scammers' employment traps which cheat them out of money, steal their personal data or even make them carry out illegal activities.\nWhen facing unfamiliar recruitment processes and procedures,students should stay alert and exercise caution. Before taking up any job offer, they should understand the nature of the job thoroughly and assess whether they can meet the job requirements.\nThey should never be tempted by an exceptionally high salary or they may get cheated out of money or end up committing crimes. Many students take any job that happens to come their way. They should pay attention to industrial safety and avoid taking up dangerous work, such as construction work, the operation of heavy machinery, handling of chemicals and corrosive substances, work processes involving extremely high temperature, etc. They should also make use of the safety equipment provided by employers and strictly follow all safety regulations\nStay alert when seeking jobs. Watch out for employment traps.\nTip 1: Watch out for offers that are too attractive\nTip 2: Take good care of personal safety, especially at odd timings\nTip 3: Find out about yor employer and study the employment contract\nTip 4: Be informed about current affais and be ready to seek help"

      "Animal-assised thrapy was once rare and met with the objection that it would only make hospials dirty. It is,however, increasingly popular in hospitals, according to an Ontario doctor.\nFrom watching goldish swim to having a dog, animal therapy is used to help people relax and give comfort. Many hospitals and homes for the elderly now have animal therapy programs in place.\n\"People think it works and like the idea of it, so they do it,\" explains Maggie O\"Haire, a doctor in Ontario University.\nOne challenge as the practice has become more widespread has been explaining how exactly it works. \"Positive changes from animal-assisted contact are varied and there is no single way that has yet been identified,\" says O'Haire.\nThere are a number of theories, however.One is that humans have always enjoyed connecting with other living things. Another is the social support theory - the idea that therapy animals provide a form of simple support.\nIn the past ten years, animal-assisted therapy has greatly expanded. Today, programs exist that provide animals who assist with physical therapy, help tutor children in reading and provide comfort in different places such as disaster zones and university campuses.\nWhile research on the subject still has a long way to go, recently studies have shown that having a pet around can lower blood pressure, and the American Heart Association has stated that owning a dog may even lower the risk of heart disease"

I can tell you,most of the time, I just take my phone and just like me, there are now millions of people in China enjoying this cash-free life.The Chinese are now living in the People's Republic of Digital.\nSuper apps in China have changed our life, and introduced a new era where small change and cash has been left behind.\nAll is needed is a QR code,which can be found everywhere from the largest shop to the smallest stores\nWhat's a QR code? It's a Quick Response barcode with a random pattern of tiny black squares against a white background. Shoppers pay by scanning the code with their phones afer selecting their goods. No cash is needed in the transaction and everything can be paid by one swipe of your phone.\nThe fact is, every morning when I go to buy breakfast at the street cart vendor, my 4RMB Chinese jian bing (a kind of pancake with vegetables and eggs inside, which is really yummy by the way), I can just scan, beep and walk off with my pancakes!\nIt sounds like China's started the transition to a cash-free economy faster than anyone could have imagined. Experts say by 2030 China will be for all intents and purposes, cashless!\nThis is China.\nStay tuned."

This price includes the use of all tools and the owner waters the whole farm once or twice a day as needed.She also sells everything else you need.\nIt is a great community atmosphere and is very busy on Sundays. Some people take it more seriously than others and I have seen some amazing vegetables come out of the ground around here.\nThere are no real regulations and as long as you don't bother your neighbours nobody cares. Many people have barbecues there.\nI've got carrots, beans, choi sum and some herbs planted. I'm never sure what my wife is growing but she has some vegetables growing also!!\nAnyway, these allotments are all over the New Terriories and you should be able to find them if you're prepared to ask around the locals. Just thought I'd share this bit of info with you all and if anyone would like any further information or to come and have a look, feel free to ask!"

But local people do not have any say in the redevelopment and are forced to leave.\"\nIf you took a walk around Western District just a couple of years ago, you would see mostly stationery shops, bakeries, grocers and university students eating in cha chaan tengs. For years, even with its proximity to Central, the old neighbourhood remained largely untouched, retaining its traditional characteristics and flavour.\nBut when three new MTR stations --- Sai Ying Pun, HKU and Kennedy Town --- opened in the area in late 2014, they brought with them a whole range of bars and expensive restaurants that drew in young rich hipsters. Today, Western District is the new, trendy neighbourhood, with young professionals increasingly turning older buildings into expensive trendy flats, forcing many long-term residents to leave the area that has been their home all their lives.\nTraditional shops are forced to leave because of high rents: 250 of the 700 shops in the Sai Ying Pun area either changed tenants or closed down from 2015 to 2017.\nThere have been multiple complaints from residents about noise from bars and restaurants. \"For families and the elderly in this area, they are disturbed by the noise every day and can't afford to shop,\" one netizen said. \"We can't stop the world from developing, but there has to be a balance.\""

One interesting photo taken by a famous photographer shows a happy couple in the bathroom with the husband sitting on the toilet and the wife in the bath!\n2. **Glamour**: Some wedding photography looks so good it could be a famous couple in a magazine spread. Posing at a beautiful location in Hong Kong has always been popular. In recent years, though, traveling to glamorous places in Europe and Japan has become common as couples look for more and more exciting and glamorous locations.\n3. **Storytelling**: Storytelling means photographing a wedding in a true or natural style. It should be fun and light-hearted, but also capture the various feelings the couple go through during their wedding. Often there are no famous buildings or backgrounds; the focus is on the relationship between the couple.\n4. **Studio**: The most traditional way of taking wedding photos is to book a studio. The advantage of shooting indoors is that all factors such as weather and light are under control. The couple are able to change into a number of different outfits. The studio also offers a more private setting and allows for more personal and detailed photographs."

And what's more, you have to be vigilant cause these online scams can come in all shapes and forms. The most common at the moment are:\n**Dating and romance scams**\nScammers create false IDs on dating websites. Once they've got your trust, they ask to borrow money which, needless to say, is never repaid. In September 2018, a local woman was cheated out of more than 100 million dollars by her online boyfriend.\n**Computer hacking**\nEmails are often used to trick people out of passwords or to use software to spy on people as they use their own computer. Once they have your password they can hack into your account (or accounts if you're stupid enough to use the same password for multiple accounts) and take control of... well, your life!\n**Online shopping scams**\nA common scam is not getting what you paid for. A scammer will sell a product, but send a faulty or an inferior product or sometimes won't send any product at all.\n**Banking and credit card scams**\nScammers send text messages and emails that pretend to be from a bank or financial institution. They usually claim there is a problem with your account and request details. They then use these details to steal money from your account."

      "Fortune telling is one of the oldest professions in the world, and it still pays a critical role in Hong Kong. It's much more a science than you think. Keen to experience the real Hong Kong culture, my friend and I went off to Temple Street and once there decided to go with the palm and face reading. We sat on our plastic stools, bargained the price and got started.\nI go first. The only thing the fortune teller asks me is my date of birth. He looks at his books of Chinese zodiac for a moment, then observes my face intensely...\n...After a while, he starts describing my life accurately! My job, how I love the outdoors, even my plans for the future. So far I'm quite impressed, he's really getting the details right. This guy is good. He sees that something changed in 2012, I went in a whole new direction in my life - the year I quit my job to travel the world. He didn't ask if I was in a relationship, but he starts describing my husband - a handsome man - and the relationship accurately. He looks at me with a very serious expression and insists: he is not the right man for you.\nAfter fifteen minutes talking, the fortune teller is exhausted. To be honest, so am I. I came just as a curious traveler, and ended up a believer. And worried about my husband!"

      "Are your children always on their phones and iPads? Do you, as a parent, worry about the websites your children are visiting? Does your family argue over screen time?\nThe answer may well be Apple's new Screen Time Control.\nScreen Time Control is a new app that allows parents to manage the amount of time their children spend on their iPad or iPhone by using their own iPhone to check the websites or apps their children are using.\nScreen Time Control also has a feature called \"Downtime\", which allows parents to block certain apps and set up a time limit for how long children can spend on their phones. That means no more late-night phone calls, unlimited playing of online games or watching YouTube videos.\nWith Apple Screen Time Control, when apps run past the time limit, their icons go dark and the apps simply won't work. Useful apps, such as e-books or homework sites or messaging for emergencies, are not affected.\nApple already has parental controls for blocking certain movies, adult websites and podcasts with explicit language, but this new feature will allow parents better control over how children use their devices.\nSo a neat new app to help parenting, although I would always recommend that it is best for families to have serious conversations about screen time. It's only through a mutual understanding about why the restrictions are imposed that all family members can understand them."

      "In recent years, Iceland, a tiny country of just 350,000 people has become surprisingly successful in international football. Ten years ago, they did not even rank in the top 100 of the FIFA World Rankings, but have now jumped up to 22nd place, drawing 1-1 with Argentina at the World Cup and beating England before that.\nThe Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA) sees Iceland as a great example of what could be done to improve local football. Both Hong Kong and Iceland face similar problems such as the lack of locations to play the sport and a lack of players. The difference lies in the fact that Iceland has invested money in building playing facilities and in training coaches.\nHoping to learn from Iceland's example, the HKFA will send representatives to Iceland to learn how to improve. Perhaps the most exciting part of all is that the Hong Kong youth team will travel to Iceland for ten days to play, allowing our young players to experience Western football and its culture.\nCritics of the $1 million project argue that such a scheme cannot solve the real problems of Hong Kong football and sport in general. Those in charge of sport in Hong Kong are often accused of not having the interests of the athletes at heart. The head of the Olympic committee came under fierce criticism in the 2014 Winter Olympics for taking six officials to the Olympics but no doctor for the competing athlete."

Its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, is now one of the richest men in the world. Today there are over a billion registered users of Facebook.\nStorm clouds may be on the horizon for Facebook though. Many young people are less interested in using Facebook than older generations. Large numbers of young people see Facebook as being something that is 'uncool' and used by older people. As a result, there is a growing trend for the younger generation to use other social media platforms such as Snapchat, a photo sharing app.\nSecurity is also causing concerns for Facebook. Criminals and terrorists have been using Facebook and large amounts of \"fake news\" in recent months have led to increasing criticism. In particular, Russia has been accused of using Facebook to try to influence election results in a number of countries.\nBut for Hongkongers the biggest worry now seems to be privacy. A recent report indicated that companies are increasingly checking job applicants' Facebook profiles before interviews to find out more about them and also what they really do in their free time. Some companies regularly check what their staff post on Facebook and a number of cases of staff being fired because of comments they posted have been reported.\nAs the young switch to other platforms and privacy issues grow, more questions are being asked about Facebook's long term success."

      "Women are on average still paid HK$15 less per hour than men, according to the latest figures released by the government.\nThe statistics, which were compiled and released by the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, showed that the hourly salary of women in Hong Kong in 2017 was HK$60.50, compared to HK$75.90 for men. The problem is even worse in terms of monthly income. Young women in the 15-19 age bracket earned HK$3,100, while young men in the same age range earned HK$5,300.\nSurprisingly, the pay difference is true of men and women of all ages and levels of education. For example, men who had received post-secondary education were paid HK$118.30 per hour, while women with the same level of education only received HK$97.80. One reason often cited by apologists of this phenomenon is that it is understandable that women are paid less because they are more likely to leave the work force to take care of family members some time in the future.\nSome students expressed disappointment at the news of the gender pay gap. Tiffany Wong, 16, was concerned about traditional views regarding men and women affecting wages. \"I think the belief that women are more suited to staying at home, taking care of the children and doing housework while men are better suited to a competitive office environment and working long hours, is still very real. Therefore, employers still tend to consider men for higher paid jobs than their female counterparts. They see it as a safer investment.\""

Please send us your findings and include any recommendations on how to handle this particular case. To deter students from repeating the same offence, we have used after-school detention for minor issues. For more serious cases, we meet with parents to try and understand any underlying issues. If a student continues to cheat repeatedly, he or she may be asked to leave the school.\nThe school regards cheating as a serious issue and we will send a reminder to all students of the dangers of copying other students' homework, using the internet to buy essays and using apps such as Google translate to do assignments.\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact any of the members on the team.\nThe Disciplinary Team"

      "In every lift in Hong Kong, the lettering on the \"door close\" button is worn with overuse. I've even seen people close the door before selecting the floor they want. On many occasions, I've had people stare at me blankly with a finger firmly on the button as I raced across a lift lobby. Why does this happen? Just to save a few seconds?\nI see this attitude of self-importance and selfishness in other parts of Hong Kong culture. It is rare to see people hold doors open, offer seats to the elderly or let people pass them on the pavement.\nPerhaps we should remove all the \"door close\" buttons from lifts. It would give us an extra few seconds to consider others.\nPeter Lok",
      "I disagree with Peter Lok's logic in his July 27 letter. Why is there a door close button if we shouldn't use it? Is it there just to show we are polite because we do not press it?\nSurely, if someone is in a position to press that button and does not press it, they are being rude.\nThe button is there to be pushed, to save busy people many seconds at a time so they do not have to wait for the door to close automatically.\nIn the same way, if we hold the door open for everyone we will never get to work.\nJudy Lai"

      "Hong Kong has fallen in love with odd English names. Unusual names are everywhere: a top government official is called York, celebrities called Bambi, lawyers Bunny. Names not found in English-speaking countries are becoming more common.\nTo understand why Hongkongers choose to be called Ice or Chocolate instead of John or Jane, we must explain why we use English names in the first place. In the early 1980s, 90 percent of secondary schools taught in English. At that time it seemed desirable to have an English name for business or when working with foreigners. In school, it was easier for English-speaking teachers to remember students' English names than their Chinese ones. As locals tend to only use their Chinese names with people who are really close, like family members, it became normal to use an English name when meeting people for the first time.\nBut the use of strange names?\nPartly, it is \"incomplete knowledge\" of the English language. Febrar might have been a misspelling or the result of someone over-generalizing the use of the names of the months like April, May or June, or both. Also many unusual English names come from Chinese: Singer Lee Hak-kan's English name is Hacken.\nNow the younger generation has found traditional names less attractive and want to be unique and different, taking names from brands like Chanel and Rolex. \"I love my English name,\" said Dictionary Leung, \"I am the only Dictionary Leung in the world!\""

CCTV is often a helpful tool in criminal investigations, but having cameras in public and private places does not necessarily prevent crime.\nWhy then does the Hospital Authority have 5,400 cameras at its public hospitals or the Legislative Council have 443 CCTV cameras outside? And how will these recordings be used?\nPeaceful protesters worry about being arrested, criminals steal CCTV cameras to help them commit crimes, private investigators use CCTV to spy on cheating couples but the biggest worry is the lack of laws to regulate the use of CCTV in public or private areas."

He hopes it will become a major international event. He is set to make the trip in 2023, and he will fill the rocket with a range of different artists from Earth.\nMr Maezawa, 42, said he wants his guests for the lunar orbit \"to see the moon up close, and the Earth in full view, and create work to reflect their experience.\" Mr Musk said the trip will cost \"a lot of money\", but declined to disclose the exact amount. Such missions are thought to cost at least US$150 million. \"I did not want to have such a fantastic experience by myself,\" said Mr Maezawa. \"I wish to create amazing works of art for humankind.\"\nHe didn't immediately say who will be on his guest list for the spaceflight. The mission will not involve a lunar landing. Space tourism began in 2001 when California businessman Dennis Tito paid for a journey on a Russian rocket to the International Space Station.

      "Singapore is at a crossroads in its management of wild monkeys, and to cull or not to cull these native animals has emerged as a key question.\nCulling, the selective killing of animals to manage their population, continues to provoke debate amongst people over how best to deal with monkeys as well as stray dogs and wild boar.\nComplaints about problems caused by monkeys fell sharply from 1,860 instances in 2013 to just 750 last year after a large number of monkeys were culled by The Veterinary Authority (VA). The VA killed about 570 monkeys, about a third of the estimated population during that period. The VA maintains that it only culls animals as a last resort. It has also explained that moving the monkeys is not feasible as that simply transfers the problem from one area to another.\nBut animal welfare groups in Singapore believe the success of campaigns to get people to stop feeding the monkeys has helped reduce the number of complaints about monkeys, not the culls. They also suggest the use of birth control on females would further help the situation. The government has stressed that birth control can only be part of a wider programme. In Hong Kong, for instance, planting fruit trees to provide more food for monkeys has reduced the number of such complaints.\nThe government must now decide if is to embark on another round of culling wild monkeys to alleviate the problem further."

      "On a recent trip to Japan I was amazed to see hotel staff in the hotel I was staying at using what turned out to be a translation gadget. The reception staff wore them around their neck to translate questions and answers from Japanese into Chinese and English so that they could communicate with tourists successfully even though they only spoke Japanese. The fast and accurate translation greatly improved our trip as there were no miscommunications and all the staff could quickly answer any problems we had. Although at times the translation was a little bit strange, it was never too bad to understand.\nTranslation apps and machines such as Google Translate are developing so fast that they are now able to do many tasks in both written and spoken translation. While I understand that they are still not able to do complicated translations of literature and legal documents, they are already effective in many areas of business and tourism. Westerners in China often use translation apps to help understand menus.\nI am sure that translation devices will continue to develop and soon will be able to translate from Chinese to English more effectively than most university graduates. This raises the question of whether or not we need to invest so much time and money in learning foreign languages at all.\nWhy should Hongkongers spend 15 or 16 years learning English or Putonghua if they can buy a cheap app that can help them communicate even more accurately?"

      "The next time you are standing at the top of a waterfall, take care when you have the urge to snap a quick selfie. It could be the last thing you do. More than 250 people worldwide have died taking selfies in the last six years, according to a new study.\nResearchers found the leading cause of selfie-related deaths to be drowning, followed by incidents involving transport. For example, falling from a cliff into the sea below or taking a selfie in front of a train. Other causes of selfie-related deaths are taking photos with live animals. A German woman was recently killed while taking a selfie with an elephant.\nThe report noted that while the simple act of taking a selfie isn't dangerous in itself, the problem arises when people take risks while trying to get that perfect shot. It also pointed out how many of the selfie-related deaths involved young people. More than 85 per cent of the victims were between the ages of 10 and 30. It was difficult to confirm the exact number of people seriously injured or needing medical help, but the researchers believed it was extremely high and growing every year.\nSelfie-related deaths have now become a serious safety concern."

In this measure, the higher the Gini coefficient, the greater the wealth gap.

      "Co-living is the latest trend to hit Hong Kong's property market. In a co-living building, tenants usually have their own bedroom but share the kitchen, bathrooms and living areas. It can be substantially cheaper than normal renting and has the added potential benefit of fostering a community spirit. We went to Weave, a co-living space in Prince Edward, to find out more about it.\nThe 13-storey Weave feels like a university hall of residence, but more grown-up.\nThe first two floors of the building are taken up by a restaurant. There is also a games area. On the third floor is the kitchen and living area, which includes a reading corner, a gym, some sofas and a TV - perfect for group movie nights. There are also vending machines around the room for late-night needs.\nThe rest of the floors have bedrooms, some shared and some private. Shared rooms are around 250 square feet and can sleep four people. They also have a bathroom. These rooms are the least expensive, at around HK$7,200 per month. Standard rooms are for one person and have their own bathroom, but they are only around 100 square feet.\nFinding somewhere to live in Hong Kong that is both comfortable and affordable is a real challenge, and not everyone can commit to a long-term contract. Co-living takes away this pressure, while also ensuring that you have a clean, safe, and well-maintained place to sleep, eat and relax."

      "We all know that Hong Kong has a housing crisis, but did you know the number of \"McSleepers\" - those sleeping overnight at McDonald's - has increased nearly 600 percent over the past five years?\nA recent survey found 334 \"McSleepers\" sleeping overnight at McDonald's 24-hour restaurants, and that number is most likely only a small part of the total.\nI can't help wondering whether the homeless would have been thrown out onto the streets if they had curled up for a nap in other restaurants or in air-conditioned places. So staff at the McDonald's should be praised for showing kindness to people without a place to sleep at night.\nAccording to the survey, reasons why people choose to sleep at McDonald's include staying in an air-conditioned environment, security and the use of bathrooms. Some \"McSleepers\" complain that the government is not doing enough to reduce homelessness. They claim that the conditions in the homeless shelters provided by the government are so bad that they actually prefer McDonald's to having to return to such shelters.\nThe question is how long this can go on. If the number of \"McSleepers\" grows, sooner or later McDonald's will have to ask if it can still manage to provide a safe place for these people to sleep. Those sleeping in their restaurants take up space, often make customers feel uncomfortable and at times make their restaurants difficult to keep clean."

      "The US President Donald Trump is 71 years old. Dr. Mahathir became the Prime Minister of Malaysia at 92. Isn't it time we considered age limits to make room for a younger generation of leaders?\nThere certainly are some benefits to having older political leaders: they can draw on the wisdom and life experience gained over decades of high-level decision-making. But there's also no doubt that being a world leader includes work and travel requirements that can be physically demanding and difficult for some older people to handle, not to mention the mental attentiveness that is needed to stay focused.\nPerhaps the biggest issue that surrounds elderly leaders is whether or not they are able to understand the modern world. Some have questioned how people who grew up decades ago can possibly understand young people today. Younger leaders, like French President Emmanuel Macron at 39, are equipped with a more personal understanding of the current issues and some might say are more able to guide the new generation in the coming years.\nWith an aging population, this problem is becoming increasingly recognized, and in some countries there have been attempts to introduce legal age limits for heads of state or government. France recommended banning politicians over 70 from standing for election but the idea was rejected because it might be considered discrimination against someone based on their age."

It has the sort of food and beverages you'd expect in a Japanese convenience store, but there aren't any employees at the check-out counters. That's because the payments are all done through a slick, unmanned system.\nOne difference you'll notice right away is that there's a gate you pass through when entering the shop. As we stepped through, a recorded voice called out,\"Irasshaimase!\"(\"Welcome!\")\nThe total selection of products isn't quite as wide as it is at some Family Marts, but customers can still get toiletries and face masks.\nThere actually is one Family Mart employee on the premises, who only handles shelf-stocking and customer inquiries. When we walked up to the check-out counters with our purchases, no human cashier was present. We didn't even have to scan anything. The terminal already knew what we had in our hand to buy and it made an electronic beep to draw our attention to the screen, where the total amount to be paid was displayed. You can pay with an e-money card, credit card or cash.\nOh, and by the way, there's also a gate you have to pass through in order to leave the store, and if you have an unpaid bill, it won't open up until you settle your account."

Many youngsters are choosing to use online movie streaming services instead of going to the cinema to watch films.\nThe popularity of streaming services such as Netflix, Disney Plus, and Apple TV further increased during the COVID pandemic because cinemas were shut down everywhere. Now, more than 200 million people use Netflix to watch movies and TV shows. This is due to four main advantages it has over cinemas.\n1. You can choose from thousands of movies and TV shows to watch.\n2. The monthly price of Netflix is cheaper than one movie ticket.\n3. There is original content on Netflix you cannot watch in cinemas.\n4. You can watch movies anywhere on your phone and laptop.\nA study also shows that after joining Netflix, 30% of people go to cinemas less often and 15% of them don't go to cinemas anymore. While this is good news for movie streaming services, cinemas are closing down due to a lack of demand, and a number of the biggest cinema chains around the world have filed for bankruptcy.\nThis brings up the question: Is this the end of cinemas?"

      "\"Night owls' are people who are naturally more awake and active at night and tend to go to bed late. Research has found that night owls face higher rates of poor health, including having a 10 percent higher risk of dying younger than 'early birds' or people who get up early and feel more energetic first thing in the day. Night owls often suffer from long-term lack of sleep and this can increase the chance of diabetes, heart disease and obesity.Not having enough sleep even for just one night can make us moody, when it happens every single night for an extended period, depression can develop.",
      "Early Birds VS. Night Owls\n8\nAssociate professor Kristen Knutson at Northwestern University said: \"This is a public health issue that cannot be ignored. We need to recognise that people have different body clocks which regulate the time we feel sleepy and wakeful throughout the day. Some people naturally wake up early while others feel more awake at night. All of this comes down to a combination of genes and the person's environment.\"\nEmployers can benefit from adjusting start times to suit individual employees' needs. Another study found that when companies let night owls start work later in the day or allowed them to work from home, there was an estimated USS277m gain in productivity. It argues that people who are more awake at night should be allowed to start and finish work later. Not everyone is suited to get up for an 8am start"

      "A majority of teens are online and most of them use social networking apps such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat. This makes social media a convenient way for teachers to connect with students. Some teachers think that as Instagram is what most teenagers use these days, it is a good idea for teachers to connect with students in this way to maintain their interest. Some parents agree that this allows teachers to be leaders and role models for their students online.\nBut at the same time, students should learn to know the difference between personal and professional communication.At school, students do not talk to their teachers as if they were friends, but when interacting with teachers on social media, the line between personal and professional communication is less clear. Therefore, it is recommended that students should not talk to their teachers like their friends on Instagram. Otherwise, they may cross that line.\nRecently, a number of parents have also complained about seeing teachers wearing swimsuits and gym clothes on their Instagram accounts. These parents claimed the photos were inappropriate. In order to avoid such problems and complaints, some schools are proposing a new policy not to allow teachers and students to be friends on social media."

Not only that, but nearly 40% have lowered their standards of what's acceptable to wear since lockdown began.\nSocial media has also played a big role in revolutionizing fashion since early 2020.Tiktok, Instagram, and YouTube have influenced fashion choices., One-third of respondents said they have purchased clothing seen on social media during the last year.\nSince people have been working from home, offices no longer require workers to wear a professional outfit'. More than 20% of survey respondents said they won't return to how they dressed before the pandemic. Spending more time at home for work and entertainment has given more people the freedom to express themselves and get more experimental with fashion."

      "Wearable smart devices, commonly known as wearables, have become popular over the last ten years. Smartwatches like the Apple Watch are likely the best-known ones. But there are many other kinds of new smart devices you can wear on your body now, including clothing and jewellery.Let's take a look at two of them.\nSmart Ring. The most common kind of smart jewellery might be the smart ring, Smart rings are worn on the finger like regular rings. But they can collect health-tracking data for the users and allow them to review it on a smartphone later.Compared to a smartwatch, the smart ring is less distracting since it cannot receive messages and can only track the user's health. And if you don't like rings,there are also smart bracelets created by well-known fashion brands.\nSmart Clothing. By covering a large amount of a user's body, smart clothing can provide more information than other wearable devices. It allows for better medical care and lifestyle improvement. For example, there are smart shirts capable of diagnosing respiratory diseases, smart shoes that monitor running performance, smart yoga pants that vibrate to improve form during exercises, and smart swimsuits that alert the user to apply sunscreen. A luxury brand also added location-tracking to its jeans to track how frequently the customer wore them, so that the brand can reward frequent wearers with more of its products."

      "Social media has taken the sharing of knowledge to an entirely new level, but we face so much information we often don't know what to do with it. Here are some ways to reduce the impact of social media on your mental health and help you use social media to spread positivity instead.\n1. Be intentional about using social media.\nWhen you show up to use a social media platform, such as Instagram, ask yourself,'Why am I here? If you don't have any need to be on that platform then, close the app.\n2. Filter the noise.\nGo through your feeds and delete anyone who isn't contributing to a positive environment. You can't change the way people act but you can change your experience using these platforms quite easily.\n3.Don't use it to fill time and space.\nIf you are using social media to kill time,you might want to ask yourself why. Why do I have to be entertained every second of the day? There's nothing wrong with being bored standing in line.\n4.Remove yourself from the negativity.\nAt the end of the day, if you feel Tike you can't handle it or social media is really impacting your happiness in a negative way, it might be a better idea to remove yourself from it entirely.

She had 60% Manchurian ethnicity-a north-eastern group. This then led to a search of her grandmother's surname,which revealed that her great-great-great-grandparents were actually from the Red Banner - a royal family group in Manchu society during the Qing dynasty. In the process, she also reconnected with a few distant relatives she never knew existed.\n\"The DNA test was such a good experience that I've just bought another DNA testing kit.

The trio wanted to build an app that would help to declutter the mountain of stuff they'd accumulated. The idea was to build a mobile-first version of US-based classifieds platforms like eBay and Craigslist. They were guided by a simple question: how can we reduce the time it takes to list a product?\nFor decades,when newspapers dominated the classifieds business, it would take a few days for an ad to show up in the papers. Then came the internet. Online classifieds like Craigslis cut that time to 30 minutes. You'd take a picture with a camera, transfer the file to a computer, connect to the internet and upload the listing.\nAs smartphones began to hit mass adoption, the founders aimed to build an app that allowed users to upload a listing for secondhand electronics, fashion, even cars and property.All within seconds.

      "Super Bowl Advertisements\nThe Super Bowl is the championship game of the American National Football League (NFL).Super Bowl TV commercials are a cultural phenomenon as they have been among the United States' most-watched television broadcasts.These advertisements are high-profile and some viewers only tune in to watch the commercials rather than the game.\nThis year, the advertisement that won the 'Best Super Bowl Ad Competition' was a heartwarming commercial for Doritos, a brand of potato chips. In the ad, a kid dressed as a cowboy rides his big dog and uses a rope to lasso a bag of Doritos out of his brother's hands.",
      "The winning ad showed how Super Bowl commercials sometimes can be less about creating laughter and more about appealing to the heart. \"The ad touched the depths of my soul,\"says Char Baringhaus, a middle school teacher from Michigan.\"Nothing reaches raw emotion like the love of animals.\"\nSometimes, the best way to sell a product is to tell a good story and create an emotional connection between the product and the viewers. A story that relates to our common experiences in life and has some elements of humour and surprise is a winning formula."

      "A survey of educators highlighted ten habits that successful students share:\nGet organised, Plan what you're going to do and when you're going to do it.\nDon't multitask, Studies have shown that multitasking is physically impossible.\nDivide it up. Divide your work into manageable chunks and reward yourself when you finish each chunk. This will make studying (more) fun.\nSet a schedule. Do you work better right after school or after you've eaten dinner? Are you more productive in 90-minute blocks or half-hour spurts? Find a schedule that works for you and stick to it.\nTake notes. Taking notes will not only keep you more engaged during class,but also help you narrow down what you need to study. It's much easier to reread your notes than to reread your entire textbook!\nReview.Review your material several days ahead of time, in smal chunks. Use flashcards or take practice tests. But don't cram.\nManage your study space. Find a place away from the television and other distractions. Whether it's the library or your bedroom, set aside a space that you'll want to spend time in.\nFind a study group. Get together witha group of people who are learning the same things. Teaching others helps you learn at the same time.\nAsk questions. Don't be afraid to ask questions or for help from a teacher or your friends. This will truly help you understand the material\nSleep. Getting a good night's rest will sharpen your focus and improve your working memory."

Different cultures have different views on how to use time.For example, in Switzerland or Germany, punctuality is important. Being late is unacceptable and often viewed as disrespectful. Other cultures on the other hand, don't stress punctuality. They might be an hour late, a day late, a week late. And that's okay. Time is not ruled by a schedule, and neither is business.",
      "1\nPsychologist Robert Levine analysed different cultures and their attitude towards time. He found that more economically developed countries like the USA, Germany, or Japan are fast-paced. In other words, they greatly value time since \"time is money\".\nOn the other hand,countries with less developed economies are slow-paced. Cultures such as the Middle East, South America, or Eastern Europe have a more relaxed attitude towards time. They are more family and socially oriented.\nHowever, such differences may not always be as clear. For example, even though Japan has a fast-paced culture, they view social relationships as important."

      "According to a recent study, Hong Kong people walk an average of 6,880 steps a day, compared with a world average of 4,961, making them the most active in the world.\nResearchers said they hoped their study could help policymakers around the world design towns and cities that encourage more physical activity.\"In cities that are more walkable, everyone tends to take more daily steps, whether male or female,young or old, healthy or obese,\" Jennifer Hicks, one of the researchers, said.\nThere are many studies suggesting there are health benefits of walking,even if only for 30 minutes a day. Some say walking fast is best, others believe walking slowly is good enough, and a few recommend a steep flight of steps. The advice for those who want to add a few extra years to their life is that, whenever possible, taking the footpath will pay off better than getting into a vehicle. Most Hong Kong people walk a lot, but out of necessity, not choice.\nStudies say it is a good thing, though: walking prolongs life. It reduces the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, respiratory and heart diseases, and even cancer. Walking is also free. It's convenient,requiring no special training or equipment, and it can be done at any age. Hong Kong people have obviously worked all that out."

      "Schools replace History and Geography with Computer Programming\nThe Australian Federal Government recently decided to replace history and geography as compulsory subjects in secondary school and bring in computer programming classes instead. This will see students from as young as Primary 5 learning about how a computer works and how to write their own computer programs. Computer classes in school used to be about learning how to use Ms Word and Excel - now it's looking at the world like an engineer - developing logical thinking and creativity.\nThe move makes sense given how much technology is in our lives and practically every job requires you to demonstrate some kind of computer skills. Equipping children with advanced computer skills early on in life could help them secure a bright future in a world which is becoming more high tech. This is something that other countries like the US and UK are already doing.\nHowever, some people think that teaching children history and geography is equally important. Studying history teaches children to learn from the mistakes people made in the past, which will help them to develop sound decision-making and judgement skills. Likewise, studying geography helps us to understand the connectivity between people and places and to appreciate the Earth as the home that we all share. It can teach us how to better manage the planet's resources and to become a better global citizen."

      "Great teacher = great results?\nThe great teacher myth is often presented as a simple equation: great teaching gets great results. Many people support it but it is completely wrong.\nThe great teacher myth sounds plausible. After all, children spend a lot of time at school and we spend a great deal of money on education.By the time they are 16,children have been at school for 10,000 hours, which is often said to be the minimum needed to master a skill. Surely teachers must be the biggest factor in ensuring that all this effort is worthwhile?\nThe key problem with this idea is when it comes to exams and learning, children are the ones who actually have to do the hard work. Unfortunately, much to the frustration of every teacher - and parent -in the city, children don't always do what they are told,or learn what we attempt to teach them.What's more, some children find school and learning easy and some don't.\nTrying to teach anyone anything is difficult unless they actually want to learn, and can do so. Learning is hard work; it requires effort, repetition, practice, mental and physical exertion.\nDoes that mean that teachers don't matter? Of course it doesn't. They help and provide excellent support, but we should understand they are not the most important factor in educational success."

This is such a tremendous waste of paper.\nNearly all university students these days own laptops. These can be used to access online learning resources systems (in HKU and most of the other universities, it is called Moodle) onto which lecturers will upload teaching materials. As long as teachers upload their handouts, there is no need for printouts.\nThis can significantly reduce the amount of paper used for teaching purposes. It is through this kind of cooperation that we can ensure the sustainability of our world.\nAnson C.Y. Chan, North Point"

      "Laid-back life in Taiwan is very tempting\nI refer to Nick Westra's article \"Why are so many Hongkongers moving to Taiwan?\". I agree that a lot of people from Hong Kong are realising that Taiwan is the ideal place for them to settle down.\nThe living environment in Hong Kong is becoming more difficult. Costs keep rising in what is already one of the most expensive cities in the world, especially when it comes to property prices and rent. People have to work long hours to earn enough to cover living expenses. They don't have enough time to spend with their families and are so tired that on Sundays they often sleep all day.\nLife in the city is too hectic, and the workplace is too competitive.\nHowever, the pace of life is much slower in Taiwan. I think you can enjoy a much less complicated way of life there and being away from the fierce competition in Hong Kong's offices must be very liberating.\nFamilies with children can have a good quality of life because, although the salaries are lower in Taiwan, the cost of living is also much lower.\nWhile it is a big change in lifestyle, I am sure people who relocate to Taiwan will eventually adapt to living there and enjoy living there.\nLily Wong, Kwai Chung"

      "Want to get fired up? The Hong Kong Fire Services Department is seeking hundreds of recruits\nAs a member of the Hong Kong Fire Services Department (FSD), whose primary purpose it is to serve and protect the community, a Hong Kong firefighter has a challenging career. At the same time,being a firefighter offers a variety of career opportunities, is hugely rewarding and has an excellent starting salary ($18,000 per month).\nThe men and women of the FSD can be called upon to cover a range of incidents, including traffic and industrial accidents, gas leakages, landslides, flooding, building collapses, and even malfunctioning lifts\nIn the next year,the FSD is aiming to recruit 60 station officers and 160 firefighters.\n\"The first and most important question that anyone considering a career as a Hong Kong firefighter should ask themselves is:'Do I have the wholehearted willingness to serve the community?',\" says Wong Ka-wing, divisional officer of the FSD's recruitment, training and examination group. \"Being a firefighter is about being trustworthy, and someone the public can always rely on in any situation.\"\nThose wishing to be a firefighter have to complete a 36-week training programme. Then recruits are assigned to fire stations around Hong Kong to begin a three-year probation period. \"On-the-job field training is very important because this is where recruits are dealing with real-life scenarios,\" says Wong. The FSD also provides public education and awareness training and carries out fire safety inspections on licensed premises."

      "Will everyone be eating insects by 2050?\nBy 2050 the population is expected to reach 9billion. To feed all of those hungry mouths, we will need to produce almost twice as much food as we currently do. But that isn't going to be easy. One possible solution? Insects.\nEating insects is a common practice that's been taking place for thousands of years. Around 2 billion people regularly eat insects as part of their diet, and over 1,900 species are edible. The most commonly eaten bugs are beetles, caterpillars, bees, wasps and ants.\nSo what's so good about insects? Well, they're nutritious and healthy. Insects actually have a high fat, protein, vitamin, fibre and mineral content that is often comparable to fish or livestock. Beetles, for example, contain on average 205 g/kg protein; beef contains 256 g/kg.\nRaising insects as a source of food as opposed to farmed animals is more environmentally friendly. Insects require significantly less land and water than traditionally-farmed animals and also reproduce much more quickly. Additionally, insects produce a fraction of the greenhouse gases when compared with other livestock, particularly cattle. Finally, insect farming can provide jobs and income to people living in poor areas. Insects are sustainable, green, nutritious and could help people out of poverty. Chocolate-covered caterpillars, anyone?"

He said, 'I had a good business and a good life when one day I was pulled from my bed into an alien spacecraft' At first he refused to co-operate with the aliens. But as the years passed, he got to understand more about them and even seemed to have won the trust of the aliens. 'They know us better as a person than we know ourselves. Not only can they read our minds, they also have the technology to be invisible,' Sparks insists.\nWhile many of the audience listened quietly, some had clearly had enough. One of those who headed for the door said, 'He's a pretty good storyteller because he seems so sincere, but for me it's too much like science-fiction.'"

      "Body art expresses individuality\nMore and more teenagers are turning to different forms of body art, such as tattooing and nose piercing, to establish their personal identity and look different. One of the main reasons young people decide to modify their bodies is to look cool. Teenagers want to express their individuality and have a strong desire to stand out from the crowd. This gives them a sense of uniqueness that makes them different from everyone else.\n19-year-old James Keen is a typical example. He is one of the first in Hong Kong to have had the tip of his tongue split into two.'When I first saw it in some teen magazines,I thought tongue-splitting was the most beautiful thing I'd seen in my life,' says James. Most of his friends do not know that he has had his tongue split unless he shows it to them.When asked how he felt about the splitting process, James said it did cause some pain for about a week, especially when he ate,but he believed it was worthwhile.'Piercing of the ears,nose and lips is just too common.I wanted something different.'"

      "The Respectable Addiction\nPeople in Hong Kong are famous for working long hours. However,it is now recognized that obsession with work can be an addiction. In Japan, it is called death by overwork and it is estimated to cause 1,000 deaths per year. In the USA, it is known as the 'respectable' addiction.\nAddiction to work is not the same as working hard or putting in long hours. Hard-working people generally have some balance in their lives. They spend a lot of time at work,but also set aside time for their hobbies, such as playing sport. However, work addicts think about work even when they are playing sport. The obsession with work is total. It prevents them from maintaining healthy relationships and outside interests. Work addicts neglect their health and ignore their friends and family. They avoid going on holiday so they don't have to miss work,and even if they do go on holiday,they still think about work.\nOften, work addicts only realize they have a problem when something terrible happens, for example,when their health completely fails or they start having family problems."

      "Vocational training in Germany\nDid you know most German students don't want to go to university? Instead, vocational education and training (VET) is a very common pathway to gain skills and embark on a successful career. VET combines job-training and study, so students can both study and work at the same time. VET offers certifications for people who are interested in becoming an electrician, tax specialist, nurse, ambulance worker, dental technician, hairdresser, film and video editor, and product designer.\nDepending on the job, trainees may work for three to four days a week in the company, factory, or shop to learn practical skills through on-the-job training. Trainees earn a modest salary which helps with student expenses.\nOn the other days, students go to school to learn both job-specific and general education subjects, such as English, maths, and physical education. The program usually lasts between two and four years. At the end of the training, students take an examination and are then given their certifications. They can continue to work in the place they were trained, study to obtain further qualifications or even become self-employed.\nThe VET program supplies Germany's companies with well-trained employees. It also helps trainees transition into work life. VET opens up a variety of promising career options for young people. Both young people and adults wanting to change careers can take part."

All over Hong Kong, in wet markets, the odour of fish stalls is another reminder of how close Hong Kong is to the sea.\nJoss sticks and incense\nIn Chinese temples, burning joss sticks and incense gives off a relaxing and woody fragrance that reflects the cultural roots of Hong Kong.\nStreet food\nHong Kong people love street food, particularly food that has strong flavours and smells: curry fish balls, stinky tofu, egg tarts and fried chestnuts.\nExhaust fumes on the road\nUnpleasant as it may be, the smell of the exhaust gases from cars, lorries and buses all year round just reflects the busy traffic and the energy of the city.\nGreenery\nContrary to most people's first impression, 75 percent of Hong Kong's territory is actually green: country parks, agricultural or semi-rural land.

Edgar Cheung Ka-long, Hong Kong's double Olympic champion would know.\nIn fact, Cheung didn't take up fencing until he was 10 years old. \"All the basketball classes were closed during the summer,\"he recalls. \"My father asked if I would be interested in a fencing course. I still remember it was a summer course for beginners. We practised footwork but that was all. Towards the end of the course,the teacher asked if anybody would like to try it with a real fence. Many of my classmates raised their hands, but I was too shy to do it in front of people. Even today, I would still consider myself an introvert. I'm not used to presenting myself during public appearances,\" he explains.\nCheung made his Olympic debut at the 2016 Rio Games. At the 2018 Asian Games, he helped Hong Kong win a silver medal in the team event. In Tokyo, his incredible run to gold included an unbelievable victory against his Italian rival in the final match. Finally, in Paris, he became the first Hong Kong athlete to win consecutive Olympic gold medals.\n\"I am happy to have won the Olympic gold medals. This is the dream of every athlete,\" Cheung says. \"But more importantly the gold medal has made a great impact on society, ensuring more Hong Kong people know about fencing and more youngsters are willing to take up the sport.\""

      "Photo-taking visitors not welcomed by everyone\nWe often take photos of such aspects of everyday life as scenery and food, and we see others posting these kinds of pictures on social media. In some places, however, people are pushing back against this trend.\nVermont, USA\nOfficials in this town recently voted to close its roads in autumn, when the leaves of the trees turn colour and the area is at its most beautiful. Hundreds of tourists began going there to take photos, and many were parking near people's private homes, damaging property and even arguing with local residents. \"Traffic in this area has steadily increased, causing environmental, safety, and quality of life issues,\"the town reported.\nMount Fuji, Japan\nIn May 2024, a Japanese town built a wall to block views of Mount Fuji, Japan's most famous mountain. Large groups of tourists started going there to take photos and refused to obey rules on throwing trash and parking. One resident said,\"When visitors don't respect rules, leave litter behind and ignore traffic regulations, then as regrettable as it is, we have to take action.\"\nBerlin, Germany\nBefore opening N&S, one of Germany's top-rated restaurants, owner Billy Wagner set a 'no photos, no videos' rule for the place. He mentions two reasons for the rule: privacy for the other diners and appreciation for the food. \"I was interested in analogue focus, which is what a restaurant visit is really all about: to smell, taste, feel, see.\" He felt that the only way that people could have that focus was to put their phones away."

      "As PC ownership declines, smartphones are on the rise\nDuring the 1990s, as personal computers or 'PCs' - including desktops and laptop computers - became more user-friendly, ownership of these devices increased dramatically. In the US, households owning a PC rose from 15%in1990 to 35%in1997.As the internet became more popular and usable, ownership continued to rise, and by 2007, about 271 million people worldwide owned a PC.\nVS\nIn that same year, something incredible happened. Apple released the iPhone, the world's first modern smartphone. That year, 124 million smartphones were sold;, within four years, smartphone sales surpassed those of PCs.By 2015, sales of smartphones were nearly five times higher than those of PCs.\nAlthough PC ownership received a brief boost during the Covid-19 pandemic, when many people had to work from home, that was short-lived. In 2022, sales of PCs dropped by 20% from the previous year, and worldwide PC sales fell again in 2023 and 2024. Smartphone sales, meanwhile, have been rising by about 10% year on year, and by 2024,nearly 60% of all web traffic was from mobile devices.\nDoes this mean that the PC is dead? Not quite, say analysts. For people who work mostly in one place, for instance, a PC is more convenient, and for gamers who play high-end video games that require a lot of power, PCs are clearly better than phones.\nIn the end, analysts say, the device you choose to use is the one that works best for you."

Since 2019, the consumption pattern of Hong Kong people in Shenzhen has gradually shifted from spending on leisure activities to everyday purchases, from dining and entertainment to medical check-ups, grocery shopping and even real estate purchases.\nTake supermarket shopping as an example. Sam's Club in Shenzhen has recently become a hit among families from Hong Kong. During weekends and holidays, it is common to see Hong Kong people stocking up on groceries and also enjoying dining after shopping.\nAaron Chan spent his New Year holidays in Shenzhen, during which he tried hot pot and barbecue and drank a lot of milk tea. \"The cost of a good meal is half the price. In Shenzhen, you are spoilt for choice and the fruit and vegetables are much cheaper,\"he stated.\nApart from being cheaper and the variety it offers, Shenzhen is attracting more people because of its high-quality services. A visitor from Hong Kong, Sally Wu, said that she had noticed great improvements in the quality of service in Shenzhen over the last few years. \"For example, service staff there will proactively inform you about discount offers, and their friendly attitude makes you feel comfortable,\" she added."

      "American teenagers today are driving less than their parents did\n14 years ago, when Zachary Grand turned 17, he couldn't wait to get his driving licence. Back then, a driving licence was considered a sign of adulthood: you were not a child anymore and could travel around freely, not depending on anyone else.\nHow times have changed. While the share of US teenagers with a driving licence was over 65% in 1995, today it is below 40%. In cities that have good public transport, the percentage is even lower.\nGrand notes that teens do not want to get their driving licences anymore. \"When I recently moved from California to Chicago, I was really surprised to see that so few young people here want to drive. It's incredible!\"\nThe reasons behind this trend are many, and complicated. For one thing, car costs have increased a lot and so have the prices of petrol and insurance. Additionally, cities and towns have grown more crowded and less car-friendly, and many states in the US have made it harder for teenagers to get a driving licence.\nTechnology is also a factor. Things that teens used to do in person - hanging out with friends, taking classes, shopping for clothes, playing games - can now be done online. Ride-hailing apps like Uber and home delivery apps have also made driving less necessary.\n\"You can do anything from your phone,\" Grand says. \"Call an Uber or even book a train or bus if you want to.\""

Emily Ko, a Hong Kong-born freelance writer is scared of turtles, and while it sounds silly to most people, that's exactly what a phobia is - an extreme fear of a threat and expecting danger that's out of proportion to the actual risk.\n\"I was five years old when my parents came home with two pet turtles,\" Emily says. \"I freaked out. Obviously, my parents didn't throw away the turtles - they put them in my brother's room. But these things live long lives...I didn't go into that bedroom for 10 years.\"\nHong Kong-based hypnotherapist Sonia Samtani has dealt with a range of phobias - some common, some not. \"I've treated people for fear of public speaking, cockroaches, needles, medical procedures, flying and dark spaces, and less common phobias such as cats, escalators, and pigeons.\" Samtani says phobias can also eat away at a person's self-confidence and self-esteem. The impact may get more severe if that person doesn't know why they are scared of something.\nHowever, there are techniques that can help people overcome even the most extreme phobias. One popular type of treatment that helps people change the way they think and behave, is to gradually expose them to their fear so they feel less anxious about it. In this way, people don't have to suffer from phobias all their lives."

The company defended its tours and said it was committed to helping \"build a responsible tourism community and improve the lives of animals in the travel industry.\"\n\"Our approach is to continually work with operators to encourage long-term and sustainable change, which not only takes into consideration animal welfare but also communities who are directly impacted by the industry,\" a company spokesperson said. \"We continue to work with our partners across the world to achieve this. One example is elephant tourism in Thailand, which comes with a cultural and religious heritage, and is beneficial for the local communities and the economy,\"she added.\nEarlier this year, the travel company vowed to end ticketing for some animal attractions. Under its new policy, situations where wild animals are drugged or abused are banned. This ban extends to circuses and shows during which animals are forced to perform unnatural behaviour.\nHowever, the animal welfare NGO, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, shared a video that showed dead bodies of horses and camels outside a tourist site in Egypt. While camel-riding activities in Egypt are listed as \"currently unavailable\" on Vapido's website, the company continues to offer camel rides in places including Dubai, Morocco, and Turkey."

      "Music groups no longer dominate the pop charts\nWhen the British rock group The Beatles first visited America in 1964, it set off a musical explosion. Not only did this group become hugely popular around the world, but young people everywhere also started buying musical instruments and forming pop and rock groups of their own.\nFor the rest of the 20th century, music groups dominated the pop charts. In the year 2000, for instance, over 80% of the songs listed in the 'Hot 100' biggest musical acts compiled by Billboard magazine were by pop,rock or hip-hop groups.\nHow times have changed. According to recent data, very few of the hottest songs from the year 2024 were from music groups. In August 2024, only one group, Imagine Dragons, had a hit in the Global Top 50. Individual performers like Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Eminem and Dua Lipa now dominate the charts.\nWhile there are many reasons for this trend,experts say that the biggest factor has been the rise of social media. As music executive Chris Price notes, social media \"is mainly a solo activity. It's easier as an individual singer to express what kind of artist you are on YouTube or Instagram than for four people to do the same thing.\"\nAnother factor is the improved technology for recording music alone, as software like Ableton Live allows people to make high-quality music at home. \"In the past, if you wanted to make music for people to dance to, you needed a band,\"says Price. \"Now you just need a laptop.\""

      "The art of self-care\nMore often than not, we are busy with work, maintaining our friendships and checking in with our families. And as we enjoy taking care of others, it's also important to take care of ourselves. Self-care is key to our physical and mental health.\n\"Self-care is when you engage in activities that take care of yourself,\" Valerie Ho, the founder of an e-commerce platform specializing in self-care products, explains. When we do not engage in self-care activities, \"physically, we feel the symptoms of stress, things like increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, headaches, and stomach upsets. From a mental health perspective, there is an increase in anxiety or depression, and emotionally, people may find themselves more easily irritated or crying without any reason,\" says Odile Thiang from MindHK, an NGO focusing on wellbeing among Hong Kong people.\nAccording to Odile, there are three pillars of self-care - exercise, sleep, and diet. Regular exercise is not only important for your physical health, but from a mental health perspective, it has been shown to treat feelings of anxiety and depression. Getting enough sleep is also an incredibly important part of self-care and helps us recharge. And watching what you eat is beneficial to both your body and your emotions.\nIf you don't know where to start, Odile suggests trying coupling - pairing something you love with something you know is good for you, but you're not too keen on. \"A lot of people find it hard to get motivated about exercising, so couple it with watching your favourite Netflix show.\""

      "Why Spirited Away Changed Animation Forever\nIn 2001, one of the most celebrated anime movies hit theatres in Japan. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli, Spirited Away would leave a mark on animation in the 21st century.\nThe story follows an ordinary 10-year-old girl, Chihiro, as she arrives at a deserted theme park that turns into a world of spirits at night. Her parents are turned into pigs by Yubaba, the witch who manages a bathhouse serving otherworldly customers. Chihiro must work in the bathhouse to save her parents and find a way to return home. The story is a tale of resilience,as Chihiro gradually finds her inner strength.\nThe movie arrived at a time when people thought animation was for children. Spirited Away destroyed prejudice about the art form and proved that a movie created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore could reach global audiences of all ages.\nJane Napier, a film critic, underlines the global impact of the movie. The movie's theme is uncertainty. \"I think this is one reason why this movie is so popular, it recognizes that the world can be scary, and that we don't always know what's going to happen to us,\" Napier explains.\nTo Yoshioka, a Studio Ghibli fan, Spirited Away can be interpreted in numerous ways by the viewer. \"This is key for the film to be loved as a classic,\" he says. \"So, even 20 years on, Spirited Away is a movie that can be watched and rewatched.\""

      "Can a personality test help decide your future career?\nThe Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a self-reported personality test that can help you find out what kind of person you are. Among other things,the test assesses people's likes, dislikes, personal preferences, and possible career paths.\nThere are 16 personality types in total in the test. Many young people nowadays take the test to see if it can help them choose a suitable future job.\nAccording to LinkedIn, a website that helps people find suitable careers, job seekers can use the MBTI test in multiple ways. First, it can help them identify their strengths, weaknesses, preferred work style, and ability to get along with others. Additionally, people can find lists online showing how common each MBTI type is in various fields of work,which can help them choose a career that matches their personality.\n\"By using the MBTI, you can discover your personality type and how it influences your work preferences, behaviours, and outcomes,\" the site reports. \"You can also use the MBTI to find careers that match your type.\"\nHowever,it is not only potential employees who use the MBTI but employers as well. In China, many companies, including large international ones, now require job applicants to complete the test, and it is one of the factors that may help them decide whether to hire someone-or not.\n\"Some companies may not want to hire someone whose personality test results do not suit their goals,\" said Ning, a senior media executive."

      "Scouts Create a Better World\nMany Scout organizations worldwide have committed to achieving the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

In Greece, for example, Scouts are given tips on how they can implement the SDGs in their daily lives, such as by asking for a donation to charity instead of a gift on their birthday to achieve Goal 1: No Poverty; or by not letting their tap run when brushing their teeth for Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.\nEveryone is welcome\nInclusion is an important principle of Scouting. \"Everyone is welcome in Scouting. One of the most important values for young people taking part is that everyone can participate and that you can be yourself,\" says Takahashi, Director of Scouting Japan. \"Cooking together at camp or sleeping in a tent promotes community life and respect for different opinions,\" says Luc, another Scout leader from Luxembourg.\nGlobal solidarity\nScouting not only brings young people together at a national level, but also internationally. Thousands of young members from 171 countries meet every four years at the World Scout Jamboree. Held in a different location each time, the 10-day educational event promotes peace and friendship."

      "A daring heart: Meet the bamboo scaffolders of Hong Kong\nIntricate bamboo scaffolding is still part of the cityscape in Hong Kong. The metropolis is one of the world's last remaining cities to use bamboo scaffolding in construction and building repair. Luckily, the Construction Industry Council (CIC) and its students are keeping this sustainable skill alive.\nScaffolders perched on bamboo frames several storeys high are a common sight, and are nicknamed 'spiders' by Hong Kong people for their agility over the scaffold.\nMo Jia Yu wraps his legs around a pole to balance high above the ground and secure a joint, a skill he must master to become a bamboo scaffolder in Hong Kong. \"You have to have a daring heart,\" says Mo, one of dozens of students who enrol each year at the CIC to learn the traditional method. \"You need courage as well as skill to survive,\"says Professor Chang from the Architecture Department of the University of Hong Kong. \"This discourages people from going into the industry.\"\nDespite the dangers involved in the craft, Chang hopes Hong Kong will preserve it as part of its cultural heritage.\nBamboo is readily available across the border in southern Chinese provinces. Its price and efficiency makes it popular, while lightweight bamboo is also easier to transport through a cramped urban centre.\n\"Bamboo scaffolds are suited to the odd and tight spaces in Hong Kong,\" adds instructor Kin Kee Wo, who has worked in the construction industry for nearly 30 years. \"It can be built in the most unthinkable places, in the most beautiful ways.\""

      "Should Teenagers Drink Coffee and Caffeinated Energy Drinks?\nTeenagers now have another thing to worry about: coffee. This time, it isn't parents trying to prohibit their kids from becoming over-caffeinated: it's Caligula Coffee, one of the largest coffee chains in the UK.\nAn employee's recent refusal to serve an iced coffee to a 12-year-old is reigniting a controversial question. Should shops be allowed to ban the sale of coffee and energy drinks to teenagers and kids?\nWhile Caligula Coffee isn't completely banning the sale of coffee to teenagers, the company's new policy allows its employees to deny serving them drinks that contain caffeine, including energy drinks. \"We do not encourage the sale of caffeine to children under 16,\" the company's spokesperson said. Some customers, including the 12-year-old's father, are upset. He expressed his outrage online saying his daughter just deserved a treat.\nBut not everyone is against a ban. The UK government, for example, has been working to prohibit the sale of coffee and energy drinks to teenagers after declaring the link between caffeine consumption and various health issues among younger consumers too strong to ignore.\nThe National Institute of Health (NIH) says that significant amounts of caffeine affect the heart and blood vessels. According to Dr George of the NIH, when it comes to teenagers and caffeine, education and moderation are both key.And it's also important to remember who you're talking to. \"Beware once you tell someone, especially teenagers, that they can't have something: they will find a way to get their hands on it.\""

      "Gap Year: Work or Travel?\nStudents always face many tests and exams. Taking a break from studies for a year and having a rest sounds attractive. A \"Gap year\", usually taken after the end of secondary school and before starting university, provides an opportunity for students to explore the world, look for a richer spiritual life and exchange cultural ideas.\nWhat did Hong Kong students do during their gap years? Oscar Chan Chi-kin, a year one business student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, didn't go to university immediately. Instead, he went to Singapore in his gap year and volunteered to help young people develop leadership skills. \"Instead of being career-driven, I hoped to gain a life direction and figure out what I love to do,\" he said. After the gap year,he knew what his ideal working environment would look like in his future career. \"Whether the company vision aligns with my personal values is really important.\"\nBesides travelling and volunteering, young people from Asia also choose to intern and work to enrich their resumés and sharpen their competitive edge. However, Sascha Choi On, a student who has just started studying at CUHK has a different view: \"Nowadays it's changing. Some of my friends took a gap year because they really wanted to find a sense of self, such as 'who I am' and 'what the goal in my life is'. Some students really care about their inner peace and happiness rather than just focusing on earning money\"she said."

      "Hong Kong's growing second-hand luxury clothes culture\nRedress, an NGO promoting sustainability through popularising second-hand fashion,is back with its seasonal \"Get Redressed #ShopSecondhand\" pop-up store in Hong Kong. Located at Taikoo Place, Quarry Bay, the second-hand pop-up store's success over the years shows a growing second-hand culture in the city. Meanwhile, online second-hand luxury fashion platforms like Hula, Vestiaire Collective and Little Dot Vintage sell discounted items from brands like Dior, Chanel, and Gucci.\nShoppers can expect to see donated second-hand clothes and accessories from all over Hong Kong, with pieces ranging from luxury designer labels to more trendy and affordable ones, according to Redress' event page. The clothing items up for resale are donated by people and collected through the NGO's takeback program. With something for everyone, the event is expected to be size- and gender-inclusive, while shoppers will be confident that they are reducing their carbon footprint by buying second-hand clothes that would otherwise end up in the city's landfills.\nAccording to Redress' 2020 study on Hong Kong's fashion consumption, changes in consumer habits were considerable after the pandemic,with two out of three actively changing their behaviour, and 30 per cent of respondents acknowledging the environmental cost of shopping habits. What is particularly interesting is that 31 per cent of respondents already own second-hand clothing, while 12 per cent have been reselling clothes online and offline as well There is no doubt about the sustainable fashion industry's potential in Hong Kong."

      "In trilingual Hong Kong, Korean language is the new kid on the block\nFor decades, French, Spanish, German and Japanese have been the most popular foreign languages among Hong Kong students. But in recent years, Korean has emerged as the new kid on the block. The latest estimate by the Korean consulate in Hong Kong showed that there were around 40,000 Korean learners in 2024 based on enrolment figures at universities and private academies.\nIn secondary schools, most Korean lessons are taught as extracurricular classes. But some have gone a step further to include the language in their curriculum as an elective. The introduction of Korean into the public school curriculum, although still at an early stage, is significant and a testament to its popularity, experts say. Professor Li Chor-Shing said the launching of Korean classes in public schools shows that many young people are motivated to learn Korean, and that it could help students with their future career prospects.\nTeachers say Korean has gained popularity in public schools as young people see learning Korean as more than just a hobby. Ms. Lai, who has taught Korean for over 10 years, said she has seen a shift in the past two to three years in the reasons young people want to learn the language. \"It used to be K-pop fans wanting to learn how to write 'Oppa, I love you' in letters to their idols,\" Ms. Lai said. \"But now, aside from that, students also see Korea as a study destination or they want to work there.\""

      "Urban beekeeping: A good idea?\nThousands have taken up urban beekeeping in Sydney. The reaction from neighbours is not always positive. Rob Simms has three beehives in his garden, and gives away jars of honey to keep his neighbours sweet. \"I delayed doing anything for six months because I thought I wouldn't get neighbour approval,\" Simms said. \"Now I give people jars of honey and everyone's happy.\"\nBut the beekeeping boom has created problems for urban living. Catherine Heath, a resident, considers herself pro-bee. However, this spring her garden has become a no-go zone because of aggressive bees, and she noticed an adjoining house had a sign on the front fence advertising homegrown honey. \"It's to the point that in good weather, we can't use the backyard most of the time\" Heath says. \"There are a lot of bees and they behave in a strange way. They attack both dogs and humans unprovoked.\"\nDouglas Purdie, president of Sydney Bee Club, said this was not unheard of. \"Bees, like all wild things, go through cycles and temperament, just like you can have a dog that's very nice today and tomorrow bites you,\"he said.\nThe Department of Primary Industries says Sydney has over 15,000 registered beekeepers and around 400,000 hives. Dr Tobias Smith, a researcher at the University of Queensland, comments that native Australian bees are stingless. \"If you have flowers around, they will just do their own thing, and you sit back and enjoy watching them,\" Smith said. \"They're a really easy pet.\""

      "Young people love subtitles; older people, not so much\nAnyone who has ever watched movies or TV shows should be familiar with subtitles.\nThese are words that are shown on the bottom or side of a screen to indicate what the speakers on screen are saying. For viewers to follow along with the story,the timing of the texts must be the same as the timing of the people speaking.\nOriginally, subtitles had two main purposes: to translate the words from a foreign language into your own language, and to allow people who have hearing problems to understand the words being spoken.\nRecently, however, there has been a new trend among young people in the UK. According to research, 4 out of 5 viewers between the age of 18-25 use subtitles all the time - even when watching movies or TV shows in their own language - while less than 25% of people aged between 56-75 do so.\n\"I think it's natural now for young people to accept subtitles,\" said UK media expert Melanie Sharpe. She added that while older people feel that using subtitles while listening to someone speak \"requires too much thinking,\" young people \"can take in far more information quickly because they're used to it.\"\nNobody knows exactly how this trend started, but one theory is that young people grew up with seeing subtitles on social media and are now comfortable with them.\nAnother factor may be the poor sound quality of streamed videos. \"They might be using subtitles because of background noise or changing volumes,\" Sharpe said."

      "An unusual career that may be one of the most desired jobs of the future\nAs artificial intelligence or 'AI' becomes more widely used and starts replacing some traditional jobs, many young people worry about their future careers.\nAccording to some experts, however, there is one popular job trend which will not be easily taken over by AI: being a 'personal shopper'.\nA personal shopper refers to a person who helps customers find products that they need by doing their shopping for them. Instead of visiting real stores or spending hours searching online, a customer with little free time can find a personal shopper with the right skills, knowledge and connections to help meet their needs.\n\"This is a job that has grown quickly,\" says American business executive Tom Ward. \"And it's grown in line with the way that customers want to shop.\"\nThe best personal shoppers have expert knowledge of their field. To become a professional clothing shopper, for instance, you need to learn everything about fashion, from the top designer names to the latest fashion trends.\nWhile AI assistants may also have such knowledge, the benefit of human shoppers is that when they visit stores to locate good quality or 'on sale' items, they build personal relationships with store owners and supply shops. This can help a human shopper see the quality of the goods, get the best possible prices, and even find unusual products not available online. These benefits, say retail experts, mean that human personal shoppers are still the best choice."

It was a tip Wei saw on Xiaohongshu, an Instagram-like social media platform popular on the Mainland and beyond.\nXiaohongshu, known for travel tips, has more than 200 million active users, with more than 70 per cent of the users born in the 1990s. The app has reshaped Hong Kong's tourism landscape, as influencers share ideas and tips for previously ordinary places. Some bring takeaways from McDonald's to MacDonnell Road in Mid-Levels for a fun photo. Others flock to Yau Ma Tei Police Station for a shot of the iconic building.\nAnother destination popularised on Xiaohongshu is a busy footbridge in Mong Kok. Colourful neon signs adorning the residential buildings are a popular draw for tourists, who want to capture the nostalgic vintage vibe of Hong Kong.\n\"The scenery, with some background music, seems quite romantic,\" a Malaysian tourist said. \"Hong Kong feels familiar because its dramas and films are very popular in Malaysia, and we go hunting for places we see on the app.\""

It also allows users to join career-related discussions and to read, and comment on, articles from their field.\nAccording to recent studies, many teenagers in North America now see LinkedIn as the hottest social media platform. This is partly because they are trying to prepare themselves for today's fast-moving job market, but also because they like the positive tone of the site.\n\"When I go on Facebook,I just see people with horrible feelings and bad ideas,\" said one teenager. \"And when I go on LinkedIn, it's so positive and honest--this is how social media should be.\"\nMany secondary students also say that they like LinkedIn because it helps them to find role models, to follow their interests, and to learn about possible future job trends.\n\"I had been interviewing teenagers about social media,\" said journalist Anya Kamenetz. \"And I learned that this site is popular with those who are really focused on their futures."

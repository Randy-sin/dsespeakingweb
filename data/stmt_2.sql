Earlier this year, the University of Hong Kong banned the sale of disposable bottled water on its Pok Fu Lam campus. This green initiative was welcomed.
Now, in this new academic year, one department at HKU has implemented an unprecedented policy - a ban on giving printed paper handouts to students..
I believe this is the right thing to do, and the initiative should be adopted by other departments and the other universities in Hong Kong as well.
A semester at our universities lasts about three months, so students will use any handouts that they are given for a very short period of time only.After the term ends,they will probably not be read again.
Sometimes, lecturers even print out in-class activity materials that are only used for a few minutes. This is such a tremendous waste of paper.
Nearly all university students these days own laptops. These can be used to access online learning resources systems (in HKU and most of the other universities, it is called Moodle) onto which lecturers will upload teaching materials. As long as teachers upload their handouts, there is no need for printouts.
This can significantly reduce the amount of paper used for teaching purposes. It is through this kind of cooperation that we can ensure the sustainability of our world.

Redress, an NGO promoting sustainability through popularising second-hand fashion,is back with its seasonal \"Get Redressed #ShopSecondhand\" pop-up store in Hong Kong. Located at Taikoo Place, Quarry Bay, the second-hand pop-up store''s success over the years shows a growing second-hand culture in the city. Meanwhile, online second-hand luxury fashion platforms like Hula, Vestiaire Collective and Little Dot Vintage sell discounted items from brands like Dior, Chanel, and Gucci.
Shoppers can expect to see donated second-hand clothes and accessories from all over Hong Kong, with pieces ranging from luxury designer labels to more trendy and affordable ones, according to Redress'' event page. The clothing items up for resale are donated by people and collected through the NGO''s takeback program. With something for everyone, the event is expected to be size- and gender-inclusive, while shoppers will be confident that they are reducing their carbon footprint by buying second-hand clothes that would otherwise end up in the city''s landfills.
According to Redress'' 2020 study on Hong Kong''s fashion consumption, changes in consumer habits were considerable after the pandemic,with two out of three actively changing their behaviour, and 30 per cent of respondents acknowledging the environmental cost of shopping habits. What is particularly interesting is that 31 per cent of respondents already own second-hand clothing, while 12 per cent have been reselling clothes online and offline as well There is no doubt about the sustainable fashion industry''s potential in Hong Kong."}'::text[], '{"what Hong Kong people normally do with their unwanted clothes","why second-hand fashion is growing in Hong Kong","ways to promote second-hand fashion","anything else you think is important"}'::text[], '[{"text": "Do you like shopping for clothes?", "number": 1, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you like to wear second-hand clothes?", "number": 2, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Do you think buying second-hand clothing is a good idea?", "number": 3, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "What do you do with the clothes you no longer need?", "number": 4, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why do some people think second-hand clothing is not a good idea?", "number": 5, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Would you be concerned about the cleanliness of second-hand clothes?", "number": 6, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "Why do people throw their clothes away so often?", "number": 7, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}, {"text": "How has the pandemic changed clothes shopping in Hong Kong?", "number": 8, "difficulty": "medium", "difficulty_level": "4-6"}]'::jsonb, '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00', '2026-02-11T16:18:37.673069+00:00');

Edgar Cheung Ka-long, Hong Kong''s double Olympic champion would know.\nIn fact, Cheung didn''t take up fencing until he was 10 years old. \"All the basketball classes were closed during the summer,\"he recalls. \"My father asked if I would be interested in a fencing course. I still remember it was a summer course for beginners. We practised footwork but that was all. Towards the end of the course,the teacher asked if anybody would like to try it with a real fence. Many of my classmates raised their hands, but I was too shy to do it in front of people. Even today, I would still consider myself an introvert. I''m not used to presenting myself during public appearances,\" he explains.\nCheung made his Olympic debut at the 2016 Rio Games. At the 2018 Asian Games, he helped Hong Kong win a silver medal in the team event. In Tokyo, his incredible run to gold included an unbelievable victory against his Italian rival in the final match. Finally, in Paris, he became the first Hong Kong athlete to win consecutive Olympic gold medals.\n\"I am happy to have won the Olympic gold medals. This is the dream of every athlete,\" Cheung says. \"But more importantly the gold medal has made a great impact on society, ensuring more Hong Kong people know about fencing and more youngsters are willing to take up the sport.\""]'::jsonb,

In some places, however, people are pushing back against this trend.\nVermont, USA\nOfficials in this town recently voted to close its roads in autumn, when the leaves of the trees turn colour and the area is at its most beautiful. Hundreds of tourists began going there to take photos, and many were parking near people''s private homes, damaging property and even arguing with local residents. \"Traffic in this area has steadily increased, causing environmental, safety, and quality of life issues,\"the town reported.\nMount Fuji, Japan\nIn May 2024, a Japanese town built a wall to block views of Mount Fuji, Japan''s most famous mountain. Large groups of tourists started going there to take photos and refused to obey rules on throwing trash and parking. One resident said,\"When visitors don''t respect rules, leave litter behind and ignore traffic regulations, then as regrettable as it is, we have to take action.\"\nBerlin, Germany\nBefore opening N&S, one of Germany''s top-rated restaurants, owner Billy Wagner set a ''no photos, no videos'' rule for the place. He mentions two reasons for the rule: privacy for the other diners and appreciation for the food. \"I was interested in analogue focus, which is what a restaurant visit is really all about: to smell, taste, feel, see.\" He felt that the only way that people could have that focus was to put their phones away."]'::jsonb,

  '["As PC ownership declines, smartphones are on the rise\nDuring the 1990s, as personal computers or ''PCs'' - including desktops and laptop computers - became more user-friendly, ownership of these devices increased dramatically. In the US, households owning a PC rose from 15%in1990 to 35%in1997.As the internet became more popular and usable, ownership continued to rise, and by 2007, about 271 million people worldwide owned a PC.\nVS\nIn that same year, something incredible happened. Apple released the iPhone, the world''s first modern smartphone. That year, 124 million smartphones were sold;, within four years, smartphone sales surpassed those of PCs.By 2015, sales of smartphones were nearly five times higher than those of PCs.\nAlthough PC ownership received a brief boost during the Covid-19 pandemic, when many people had to work from home, that was short-lived. In 2022, sales of PCs dropped by 20% from the previous year, and worldwide PC sales fell again in 2023 and 2024. Smartphone sales, meanwhile, have been rising by about 10% year on year, and by 2024,nearly 60% of all web traffic was from mobile devices.\nDoes this mean that the PC is dead? Not quite, say analysts. For people who work mostly in one place, for instance, a PC is more convenient, and for gamers who play high-end video games that require a lot of power, PCs are clearly better than phones.\nIn the end, analysts say, the device you choose to use is the one that works best for you."]'::jsonb,

During weekends and holidays, it is common to see Hong Kong people stocking up on groceries and also enjoying dining after shopping.\nAaron Chan spent his New Year holidays in Shenzhen, during which he tried hot pot and barbecue and drank a lot of milk tea. \"The cost of a good meal is half the price. In Shenzhen, you are spoilt for choice and the fruit and vegetables are much cheaper,\"he stated.\nApart from being cheaper and the variety it offers, Shenzhen is attracting more people because of its high-quality services.

  '["American teenagers today are driving less than their parents did\n14 years ago, when Zachary Grand turned 17, he couldn''t wait to get his driving licence. Back then, a driving licence was considered a sign of adulthood: you were not a child anymore and could travel around freely, not depending on anyone else.\nHow times have changed. While the share of US teenagers with a driving licence was over 65% in 1995, today it is below 40%. In cities that have good public transport, the percentage is even lower.\nGrand notes that teens do not want to get their driving licences anymore. \"When I recently moved from California to Chicago, I was really surprised to see that so few young people here want to drive. It''s incredible!\"\nThe reasons behind this trend are many, and complicated. For one thing, car costs have increased a lot and so have the prices of petrol and insurance. Additionally, cities and towns have grown more crowded and less car-friendly, and many states in the US have made it harder for teenagers to get a driving licence.\nTechnology is also a factor. Things that teens used to do in person - hanging out with friends, taking classes, shopping for clothes, playing games - can now be done online. Ride-hailing apps like Uber and home delivery apps have also made driving less necessary.\n\"You can do anything from your phone,\" Grand says. \"Call an Uber or even book a train or bus if you want to.\""]'::jsonb,
